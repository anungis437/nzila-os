## 📈 REVENUE MODEL

### **Three Revenue Streams**

| Revenue Stream | Description | % of Total (2030) | Gross Margin |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **1. B2B SaaS Subscriptions** | Annual contracts (Union Eyes, ABR, CORA, 12 others) | 75% ($4.5M ARR) | 80% |
| **2. Transaction Fees** | 1-5% commission (CORA agricultural txns, DiasporaCore remittances, Trade OS shipments) | 15% ($900K ARR) | 60% |
| **3. IP Licensing & Royalties** | White-label licensing (Gamification Engine, Pension Forecasting), post-spinout royalties (2-10%) | 10% ($600K ARR) | 95% |

**Strategic Rationale**: Diversified revenue (75% recurring SaaS, 25% transaction/IP) reduces concentration risk, enables multiple paths to $10M ARR.
