## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

# **Fragmentation in Underserved Markets**

### **Three Critical Gaps:**

**1. UNIONS LACK MODERN TECHNOLOGY** 🏭
- 13,000 North American unions managing pensions, grievances, campaigns with:
  - ❌ Spreadsheets & paper files
  - ❌ No predictive analytics (pension sustainability, churn risk)
  - ❌ Manual compliance (fiduciary reporting, CBA management)
- **Result:** $50B+ wasted on inefficient processes, member dissatisfaction, leadership turnover

**2. DEI TRAINING IS BROKEN** ⚖️
- Canadian organizations spend $1.5B/year on anti-racism training:
  - ❌ Generic content (not Anti-Black Racism specific)
  - ❌ 25-30% completion rates (compliance checkbox, no engagement)
  - ❌ No AI coaching, no tribunal case database
- **Result:** Regulatory risk (AODA, Bill 67), lawsuits, reputational damage

**3. AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE OPAQUE** 🌾
- 189,874 Canadian farms struggle with:
  - ❌ Price opacity (grain elevators, processors set prices unilaterally)
  - ❌ Fragmented logistics (700+ cooperatives, 230+ elevators, no coordination)
  - ❌ Export complexity (Port of Vancouver, USMCA, tariffs)
- **Result:** Farmer income volatility, supply chain inefficiency, $8.6B market untapped

---

### **The Pattern: Underserved Markets + Technical Complexity = Massive Opportunity**

---

## SLIDE 3: OUR SOLUTION

## SLIDE 17: WHY NOW?

# **Macro Tailwinds + Regulatory Drivers**

### **1. Union Renaissance (Union Eyes)**

**Trend:** Union membership growing for first time in decades
- **U.S.:** 16.2M members (2023) → 16.4M (2024), +1.2% YoY (BLS data)
- **Canada:** 4.9M members (30% workforce), highest in North America (Stats Canada)
- **Driver:** Gen Z labor activism (Starbucks, Amazon unionization), teacher strikes, healthcare worker campaigns

**Why It Matters:** Unions investing in technology to manage growth, recruit younger members (digital-first workflows), improve member engagement (mobile apps, AI tools).

---

### **2. DEI Compliance Mandates (ABR Insights)**

**Regulations Driving Demand:**
- **Ontario Bill 67** (2023): Mandatory anti-racism training for public sector (schools, hospitals, government)
- **AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)**: DEI training required for accessibility compliance
- **CHRC (Canadian Human Rights Commission)**: Anti-Black racism systemic reviews (federal mandate)
- **Corporate ESG Reporting**: TSX/NYSE require diversity metrics, DEI training documentation

**Why It Matters:** $1.5B Canadian market growing 15% CAGR (mandatory compliance vs voluntary training).

---

### **3. Agricultural Supply Chain Crisis (CORA)**

**Drivers:**
- **Climate Change:** Extreme weather (droughts, floods) increasing farmer income volatility, need for real-time supply chain coordination
- **Export Demand:** Canadian grain exports $30B+/year (wheat, canola, barley), Port of Vancouver congestion, USMCA trade agreement opportunities
- **Cooperative Movement:** 700+ Canadian ag cooperatives seeking digital transformation, price transparency, logistics optimization

**Why It Matters:** $8.6B Canadian AgTech market growing 20% CAGR, government support (AAFC $50M AgTech funding 2025-2028).

---

### **4. AI Democratization (All Platforms)**

**Technology Enablers:**
- **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4):** Enterprise-grade AI accessible to startups ($0.03/1K tokens vs $1+ in 2020)
- **pgVector (PostgreSQL):** Semantic search, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), embeddings without expensive vector DBs
- **Drizzle ORM:** Type-safe database access, migrations 10x faster than legacy ORMs

**Why It Matters:** Small teams (5-10 engineers) can build enterprise-grade AI products that required 50+ engineers in 2020.

## SLIDE 18: RISKS & MITIGATION

# **How We De-Risk Execution**

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| **Flagship sales slower than expected** | ✅ 3 flagships (Union Eyes, ABR, CORA) diversify revenue, pilot acceleration (5 Union Eyes pilots, 3 ABR, 2 CORA), channel partnerships (CLC, CPHR, cooperatives) | MITIGATED |
| **Churn higher than projected** | ✅ Product-market fit validation (NPS >40 in pilots), embedded workflows (pension fiduciary duty, ABR compliance mandate, CORA network effects), Customer Success team (1:50 CSM ratio) | MITIGATED |
| **Migration delays (15 platforms)** | ✅ Backbone-first strategy (build once, reuse 60-75%), automated migration (Scripts-Book Template, 85% time savings), prioritize flagships (Union Eyes, ABR, CORA first) | MITIGATED |
| **Cloud costs higher than expected** | ✅ Azure Reserved Instances (40% discount), auto-scaling policies (Container Apps scale-to-zero), database optimization (PgBouncer, query tuning) | MITIGATED |
| **Engineering talent war** | ✅ Remote-first hiring (Canada-wide, international), equity compensation (10-15% ESOP), offshore contractors (Eastern Europe, Latin America $50-$80/hr) | MITIGATED |
| **Competitive threats (horizontal giants)** | ✅ Vertical depth > horizontal breadth (be #1 in unions/ABR/AgTech, not compete with Salesforce/SAP), IP moats (patents, algorithms, 10+ years domain expertise), first-mover advantage | MITIGATED |
| **Regulatory compliance failure** | ✅ Legal counsel (Privacy Officer, external IP lawyer), compliance audits (quarterly PIPEDA/Law 25), proactive filings (trademarks, patents), insurance (E&O, cyber liability) | MITIGATED |
