## 1. Market Sizing

| Metric | Value | Methodology |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **TAM** | $50B+ | Global labor union operations, diaspora banking, pension management software |
| **SAM** | $195M | North American union management SaaS + diaspora fintech (Canada/US corridors) |
| **SOM (2026)** | $150K | 10–15 early-adopter unions on Union Eyes; DiasporaCore pilot cohort |
| **SOM (2028)** | $1.2M | 80+ unions, 3 remittance corridors live |
| **SOM (2030)** | $4.1M | 250+ unions, white-label DiasporaCore partnerships |

**Sizing methodology:** Bottom-up from 13,000+ North American unions segmented by membership count, multiplied by ACV per tier. Cross-validated against BLS union membership data (14.4M US members) and Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey (4.9M Canadian union members).

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Direct Competitors (Union Management)

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Market Share |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **BargainingPower** | Purpose-built for CBAs; strong CLC relationships | Limited analytics; no pension module; legacy UI | ~$12K–$40K/yr | ~8% of addressable market |
| **UnionWare** | Established brand; 25+ yr track record; deep membership mgmt | Monolithic architecture; no ML capabilities; slow release cycle | ~$20K–$80K/yr | ~15% |
| **iMIS** | Flexible association management; large partner ecosystem | Not union-specific; requires heavy customization; expensive implementations | ~$25K–$120K/yr | ~5% (union segment) |

### 2.2 Adjacent Competitors (HR/Workforce Platforms)

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **ADP** | Massive scale; payroll integration; compliance expertise | Zero union-specific features; hostile brand perception among organized labor |
| **Workday** | Enterprise-grade HCM; strong analytics | Prohibitive cost for unions; no grievance/CBA modules; management-side positioning |
| **BambooHR / Paylocity** | SMB-friendly UX; modern stack | No labor relations features; perceived as anti-union tooling |

### 2.3 Union Eyes Competitive Moat

- **4,773 DB entities** modeled for union-specific workflows — no competitor approaches this depth
- **238 RLS policies** enabling multi-tenant security at the row level — critical for inter-local data isolation
- **ML pipeline** for pension forecasting and churn prediction — zero competitors offer predictive analytics
- **CBA Intelligence Engine** — NLP-powered collective agreement analysis across jurisdictions

## 3. Customer Segmentation

| Tier | Union Size | Est. Count (NA) | ACV Target | Sales Motion |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1 — Small Locals** | < 500 members | ~8,000 | $15K–$25K | Self-serve + inside sales |
| **Tier 2 — Mid-Size Locals** | 500–5,000 members | ~3,500 | $25K–$50K | Field AE + demo |
| **Tier 3 — Large Nationals** | 5,000–50,000 members | ~1,200 | $50K–$100K | Enterprise sales, 6–9 month cycle |
| **Tier 4 — Federations** | 50,000+ members | ~300 | $100K+ (custom) | Strategic account, C-suite engagement |

**Initial beachhead:** Tier 2 Canadian locals affiliated with CLC and Unifor — large enough to justify ACV, small enough for <90-day implementation.
