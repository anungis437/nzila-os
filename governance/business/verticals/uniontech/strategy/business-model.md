## 1. Revenue Model

| **Analytics & Reports** | Custom reporting, benchmarking data, arbitration intelligence feeds | 5% |

## 2. Pricing Tiers — Union Eyes

| Tier | Target | Monthly Price | Annual Contract | Base Seats | Included Modules |
|------|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | Small locals (<500 members) | $1,250 | $15,000 | 10 | Membership, Grievances, CBA Docs |
| **Professional** | Mid-size locals (500–5,000) | $2,500 | $30,000 | 20 | All Starter + Elections, Comms |
| **Enterprise** | Large nationals (5,000–50,000) | $5,000 | $60,000 | 50 | All Professional + Financial Ops, Analytics |
| **Federation** | Federations (50,000+) | Custom | $100,000+ | Unlimited | Full platform + cross-local dashboards, API access |

**Pricing rationale:** Anchored at ~$2.50/member/month for mid-tier, declining to ~$1.00/member/month at scale. Competitive with UnionWare ($3–$5/member/month) and significantly below iMIS custom implementations ($5–$10/member/month).

## 3. Unit Economics Deep-Dive

### 3.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by Channel

| Channel | CAC | Payback Period | Notes |
|---------|-----|---------------|-------|
| **Direct field sales (AE)** | $15,000–$20,000 | 8–12 months | Includes AE compensation, travel, demo infrastructure |
| **CLC/Unifor referral** | $8,000–$12,000 | 5–8 months | 10–15% referral fee; lower sales effort |
| **Labor conference pipeline** | $10,000–$15,000 | 6–10 months | Booth + sponsorship amortized; higher intent leads |
| **Digital inbound** | $5,000–$8,000 | 4–6 months | Content marketing, SEO, webinars; Tier 1 skew |
| **Blended average** | $12,000 | 7 months | Weighted by expected channel mix |

### 3.2 Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation

```
LTV = ACV × Gross Margin × (1 / Churn Rate) × Expansion Multiplier

Conservative scenario:
  ACV: $30,000 (blended)
  Gross Margin: 78%
  Annual Churn: 8% (1/0.08 = 12.5 years)
  Expansion Multiplier: 1.15 (NRR 115%)
  LTV = $30,000 × 0.78 × 12.5 × 1.15 = $336,375

Base scenario:
  ACV: $35,000 (blended)
  Gross Margin: 82%
  Annual Churn: 5% (1/0.05 = 20 years, capped at 10)
  Expansion Multiplier: 1.22 (NRR 122%)
  LTV = $35,000 × 0.82 × 10 × 1.22 = $350,140

Optimistic scenario:
  ACV: $42,000 (blended)
  Gross Margin: 85%
  Annual Churn: 3% (capped at 10 years)
  Expansion Multiplier: 1.30 (NRR 130%)
  LTV = $42,000 × 0.85 × 10 × 1.30 = $464,100
```

### 3.3 LTV/CAC Ratios

| Scenario | LTV | CAC (blended) | LTV/CAC | Target |
|----------|-----|--------------|---------|--------|
| Conservative | $336K | $20K | **16.8x** | >5x ✓ |
| Base | $350K | $12K | **29.2x** | >5x ✓ |
| Optimistic | $464K | $8K | **58.0x** | >5x ✓ |

**Note:** Union SaaS exhibits exceptionally high LTV/CAC due to structural switching costs — unions rarely change core systems once member data, grievance history, and CBA archives are embedded. Target range 5–15x is conservative.

### 3.4 Cohort Analysis Framework

Track cohorts by:
- **Onboarding quarter** — measure time-to-value (first grievance filed, first election run)
- **Union size tier** — Tier 1–4 retention and expansion patterns
- **Channel source** — validate CAC assumptions; identify highest-quality leads
- **Module adoption** — correlate add-on purchases with retention (hypothesis: pension module → +15% retention)

Key cohort metrics:
- Month 3: Feature activation rate (target >70%)
- Month 6: Second module adoption (target >40%)
- Month 12: NRR by cohort (target >110%)
- Month 24: Logo retention (target >92%)
