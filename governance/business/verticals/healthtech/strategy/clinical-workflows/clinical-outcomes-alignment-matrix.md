# 🩺 Clinical Outcomes Alignment Matrix

**Owner:** Aubert

### **1. Purpose**

This matrix demonstrates how Memora’s features and interactions **indirectly support clinical goals** associated with:
- **Cognitive stimulation & daily routine formation**
- **Caregiver stress reduction & visibility**
- **Adherence to structured behavioral interventions**
- **Support for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage dementia management**

> ⚠️ Memora is not a diagnostic or therapeutic tool. This document supports alignment with clinical frameworks, not medical claims.

### **2. Clinical Domains Tracked**

| Domain | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cognitive Stimulation** | Activities and cues that promote memory, attention, and executive function |
| **Behavioral Adherence** | Patient ability to stick with routines and self-guided care patterns |
| **Caregiver Visibility & Empowerment** | Emotional relief and shared awareness of patient engagement |
| **Early Risk Observation (non-clinical)** | Passive patterns suggestive of cognitive withdrawal or change |
| **Equity in Access to Tools** | Availability of accessible and non-clinical wellness resources |

### **3. Outcomes Alignment Matrix**

| Clinical Goal | Memora Feature | Alignment Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reinforce memory recall patterns | **Memory Match / Sequence Builder games** | ✅ Direct cognitive engagement |
| Encourage task initiation | **Daily Routine Nudges from Companion** | ✅ Behavioral adherence support |
| Reduce caregiver burden | **Linked caregiver dashboard with summaries** | ✅ Empowerment & shared oversight |
| Promote consistency in cognitive routines | **Streak tracking (opt-in)** | ✅ Routine adherence signaling |
| Support bilingual patient engagement | **Full EN/FR UX** | ✅ Equity and access readiness |
| Minimize cognitive friction | **Accessibility Mode + Simplified Prompts** | ✅ Aging user optimization |
| Soft-flag disengagement | **Dashboard: “3+ days inactive” flag** | ⚠️ Observational, not diagnostic |
| Offer early self-assessment of effort | **Session completion + Companion reflection** | ✅ Encouragement for self-awareness |
| Reduce patient stress via gamified tone | **Companion praise + non-competitive feedback** | ✅ Affective wellness support |
| Respect autonomy while increasing routine | **Companion opt-in, mute, silent modes** | ✅ Consent-aligned behavioral nudges |

### **4. Mapping to Clinical Frameworks**

| Clinical Guideline | Memora Alignment |
| --- | --- |
| **Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD)** | Aligns with recommendation to support activities that promote engagement and caregiver support |
| **Alzheimer’s Disease International – 2024 Action Plan** | Supports non-pharmacological engagement and community-based support models |
| **National Dementia Strategy (Canada)** | Meets pillars on access, caregiver relief, and public health resource delivery |
| **AGE-WELL Core Research Themes** | Strong fit for Technologies for Supporting Wellness, Caregiving, and Prevention |
| **WHO Cognitive Decline Recommendations (2020)** | Indirectly supports cognitive stimulation and structure-building |

---

### **5. Cautions & Limitations**

| Topic | Clarification |
| --- | --- |
| **Diagnosis** | Memora is not a clinical tool and does not detect, classify, or treat conditions |
| **Data sharing** | Any export for research must follow consent, anonymization, and ethics board approval |
| **Intervention scoring** | Streaks and game completions are wellness signals, not validated clinical endpoints |
| **Caregiver interaction** | Messaging is prewritten; no emotional or medical advice is provided |

---

### **6. Recommended Use in Pilot Clinics**

| Use Case | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Patient encouragement | Use Companion nudges and game engagement as non-clinical homework |
| Engagement check-ins | Use dashboard “last played” and “3+ day gap” as soft prompts for conversation |
| Reporting | Pilot debriefs may reference streak counts and game frequency as indicators of usage, not outcomes |
| Research mapping | Collaborate with ethics-approved partners to map behavior to MoCA or DAS longitudinally (Phase 3) |
