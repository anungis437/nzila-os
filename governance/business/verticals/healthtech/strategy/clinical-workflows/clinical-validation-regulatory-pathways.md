# 🧬 Clinical Validation & Regulatory Pathways

**Owner:** Aubert

This section outlines Memora’s readiness and progression through **clinical validation**, **regulatory compliance**, and **evidence-based credibility**. Designed as both a documentation hub and readiness map, it ensures we stay aligned with global standards for safe, ethical, and effective healthtech delivery.

## ✅ **Clinical Readiness Levels**

| Phase | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UX Co-Design with Clinicians** | Interface, flow, and Companion behavior validated by working caregivers and neuro-specialists | ✅ Completed Q1 2025 |
| **Low-Risk Trial Deployment** | Deployed in offline mode within memory clinics and home-care pilots (no diagnostic or therapeutic claims) | ✅ Completed Q2 2025 |
| **Preliminary Care Impact Studies** | Evaluating caregiver stress reduction, patient emotional stability, and Companion trust signals | ⏳ In Progress |
| **Longitudinal Tracking Studies** | Partnering with NGOs and clinics to measure retention, routine formation, and wellbeing over 3–12 months | 🔜 Q3–Q4 2025 |

## 🧾 **Regulatory Landscape Mapping**

Memora is currently structured as a **Class I (non-diagnostic)** supportive care tool under most jurisdictions. Future evolutions will require mapping to higher tiers. Below is our current position and regulatory notes:

| Region | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Canada** | Likely *Class I SaMD* (wellness, not medical device) | Monitored under Health Canada wellness tech policies |
| **EU** | Potential *Class I MDR* or *exempt wellness tool* | No diagnostic intent or physiological data collection |
| **USA** | Under *FDA General Wellness Guidance* | Not subject to 510(k) unless clinical claims expand |
| **DR Congo / LMICs** | NGO-partnered rollout, advisory-led standards | We adhere to WHO digital health benchmarks for ethics & impact |

## 🧪 **Ethical Review & Research Partnerships**

| Organization | Role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ClinicX Memory Center** | UX & routine co-design | ✅ Completed |
| **University Partner TBD** | IRB-backed longitudinal study | ⏳ In negotiation |
| **NGO Deployment Lead** | Field evaluation of trauma-aware Companion use | 🔜 Q4 2025 |

We follow **Tri-Council Policy Statement** (Canada), **WHO AI Ethics Guidance**, and emerging **OECD AI governance standards**.

## 🔬 **Evidence Themes Under Study**

- **Emotional Regulation**: Does the Companion reduce anxiety or agitation in cognitive decline?
- **Caregiver Confidence**: Does shared view of memory routines improve caregiver assurance?
- **Resilience & Routine Formation**: Do users return more consistently to rituals/journaling?
- **Language + Cultural Adaptability**: Does multilingual personalization improve engagement?
