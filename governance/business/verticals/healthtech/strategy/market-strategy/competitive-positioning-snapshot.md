# 🧭 Competitive Positioning Snapshot

**Owner:** Aubert

### 🧩 **Market Categories We're Bridging**

Memora is not just a brain game. Not just a wellness bot. Not just a dashboard.

It **intersects** four adjacent sectors — and improves upon all of them with CareAI-powered orchestration, fatigue-aware logic, and tone-governed interaction.

| Category | Examples | Key Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brain-Training Apps** | Lumosity, Peak, Elevate | Performance-based, high-stimulation, not designed for memory loss or long-term trust |
| **Caregiver Tools** | Carely, Tyze | Transactional and logistical; lacks tone-sharing or patient integration |
| **Clinical Adherence Platforms** | MyChart, Wellframe | Built for high-functioning users; low usability in aging or memory care settings |
| **Wellness AI Companions** | Woebot, Replika | Lacks clinical alignment, memory consent control, or fallback integrity for long-term care |

### 🛡️ **Memora’s Unique Positioning**

| Attribute | Memora | Others |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fatigue-aware design** | ✅ CareAI Behavioral Pacing + rest cycles | ❌ Static or urgency-based tasks |
| **Emotionally intelligent Companion** | ✅ Tone-calibrated, swap-ready personas | ❌ Hard-scripted AI or gamified personas |
| **Caregiver + patient shared view** | ✅ Balanced via consent, minimal mode, and trust indicators | ⚠️ Caregiver-only or over-surveilled views |
| **Clinic-friendly without EHR bloat** | ✅ Dashboard built via Feedback Loop Layer | ❌ Built for hospitals or over-medicalized care |
| **Law 25 / Privacy by design** | ✅ Consent Language Kit + memory guardrails | ⚠️ Post-hoc or limited regional coverage |
| **Presence over performance** | ✅ Reflection-driven, tone-first interaction model | ❌ Streak-based, novelty-first systems |

### 💡 Why This Matters

Most platforms fail in long-term memory care because they demand:
- Too much attention
- Too often
- For too little emotional return

Memora is the first to say:

> “Care doesn’t need to be loud. It needs to be lasting.”
