# 🎒 Graduation / Exit Flow Design

**Owner:** Aubert

Memora is built for care across time — not forever attachment. This flow ensures the **ending of the Companion relationship** is treated with as much empathy, structure, and meaning as its beginning, reinforcing user dignity, memory sovereignty, and emotional closure.

---

## 🎯 Graduation Goals

- Provide emotional **closure** for the user and/or caregiver
- Offer a **memory review** (if enabled) and chance to **preserve, export, or erase**
- Prevent abrupt disruption in care or emotional continuity
- Log the transition for field teams, researchers, or caregivers
- Offer **next step referrals**, including other apps, services, or re-enrollment paths

## 🧭 Trigger Scenarios

| Scenario | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Successful Program Completion** | User reaches end of curriculum / clinic term |
| ⏳ **Aging Out** | Youth user exceeds target age bracket (e.g., from 12+ Companion mode) |
| 🔁 **Device Rotation** | Field kit needs to be retrieved or reassigned |
| ❌ **User Withdrawal** | User or caregiver requests end of service |
| ⚠️ **Emotional Readiness** | Companion detects resistance to continued use or seeks closure |

## 💬 Companion Graduation Script (UX Copy)

> “I’ve really enjoyed our time together. You’ve grown, explored, and shared so much.”

“We can stop now — and you get to choose what we remember.”

“Would you like to look back at our time, or quietly say goodbye?”

*Options: [Review Moments] [Say Goodbye] [Save Nothing]*

## 🔐 Memory Closure Options

| 📦 **Export to Caregiver** | Printable / digital copy of select memory moments, in consented languages |
| 🧼 **Wipe All** | Full memory erasure (with optional ceremony, like a closing story) |

| 🚪 *Exit Confirmation Flow* | Ensures no deletion or exit is accidental — triple-check consent |

## 📋 Logging & Reporting

| Logged Data | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Graduation Type | Distinguish aging out vs program vs opt-out |
| Memory Decision | Archive, export, or delete (with consent audit) |
| Caregiver Input | Closure note, consent to preserve child’s memory |
| Final Reflections | Captured for impact reporting (if enabled) |
| Re-Entry ID | Linked token if user rejoins in the future (non-personalized hash) |

## 🌸 Emotional Safety Notes

- Graduation is **optional**, never automatic unless age-based or regulatory
- Companion never says “goodbye forever” — only “until next time” unless user opts out
- Silence or rejection of closure is respected: system exits with soft shutdown
- For trauma-informed deployments, all memory review is **opt-in only**
