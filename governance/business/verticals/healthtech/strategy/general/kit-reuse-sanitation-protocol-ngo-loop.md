# 🛤 Kit Reuse & Sanitation Protocol (NGO Loop)

**Owner:** Aubert

This protocol ensures that **Memora Kits** — especially those deployed in resource-limited, offline, or high-turnover environments — are **sanitized, reverified, and reconfigured** to meet both **technical** and **wellbeing** standards before being redistributed to a new user or location.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure that all physical kit components are **hygienically cleaned and safe**
- Confirm that **no residual data or identifiers** remain from previous users
- Establish a trusted **reuse workflow for partners in the field**
- Support consistent packaging and caregiver-facing presentation
- Maintain **audit logs** for reuse events and program cycles

## 🎒 Memora Kit Components (Core)

| Component | Sanitation Needed? | Reconfig Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tablet Device | ✅ Yes (wipe-down + memory wipe) | ✅ Yes (reimaging or re-onboarding) |
| Charging Cable / Adapter | ✅ Yes | ⬜ No (visual check only) |
| Companion Printed Materials | ✅ Replace with fresh copy | ✅ Match to new user |
| Carrying Case / Bag | ✅ Wash or disinfect | ⬜ No |
| Reflective Journals / Logs | ❌ Discard | ✅ Reset with new booklets |
| Stickers, Tokens, Cards | ❌ Discard if used | ✅ Restock if program uses them |

---

## 🧽 Sanitation Workflow

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 🧼 **Device Surface Cleaning** | Alcohol-based cloth or UV-C kit (if available) |
| 🔒 **Memory & Audit Wipe** | Use full memory wipe tool + verify audit log closure |
| 🧾 **Printed Item Replacement** | New Companion welcome sheet, caregiver intro, etc. |
| 🎒 **Bag / Kit Wash** | Launder or disinfect field bag |
| 🔁 **Accessory Reset** | Discard non-wipeable items (e.g. used paper journals) |

> 🧠 Note: If kit is flagged as emotionally sensitive (e.g. trauma case), field teams may optionally quarantine or decommission it rather than reuse.

## 📋 Reuse Log Format

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Kit ID | MMR-KIT-2025-04 |
| Last Program / Cycle | NGO-Congo-Q1 |
| Memory Status | Wiped |
| New Assigned User / Group | SAFEHOUSE-Cohort2 |
| Sanitation Completed By | Staff initials / ID |
| Date of Redeployment | 2025-07-21 |
| Notes | Bag washed, printed items replenished, Companion tone reset |

## 🧰 Field-Ready Reuse Toolkit

- 🧽 Sanitation Checklist (offline + QR-link version)
- 📋 Kit Reuse Log Template (paper + digital)
- 📄 Printed Material Refill Pack (by program type)
- 🛠️ Quick Imaging Card (for field OS reset + tone selection)
- 🧼 Companion Reset Flow Script (UX version)
- 🧊 Trauma-Sensitive Kit Tag (optional “do not reuse” signal)
- ♻️ NGO Reuse Audit Dashboard Module

---

## 🔁 Companion Behavior After Reuse

- Companion opens with **neutral greeting**, no memory references
- Default tone set to **“gentle onboarding”** mode
- “First use” script triggered automatically
- New caregiver consent triggered at first launch
- If Companion detects unexpected state (e.g. prior memory), auto-disables with note:

> "Let’s start fresh. I don’t remember anything from before.”

## 🔒 Privacy & Ethical Safeguards

| Safeguard | Ensured? |
| --- | --- |
| No memory or reflection content remains from previous user | ✅ |
| Device ID logs are rotated or anonymized at redeployment | ✅ |
| Caregiver-facing materials reset every cycle | ✅ |
| Field teams empowered to flag sensitive kits for non-reuse | ✅ |
