# COO Playbook Overview

**Owner:** Aubert

## 🧭 Purpose

This playbook defines the operational model, tools, systems, and execution rhythms that power Nzila Ventures. It ensures that vision turns into traction — through clear ownership, repeatable processes, and measurable outcomes.

The COO owns and governs this system, enabling all departments to scale without chaos.

---

## 🧱 Core Operational Philosophy

Nzila operates on the following execution principles:
1. **Clarity over bureaucracy** – Light documentation, high transparency
1. **Sprints over slogs** – Small, fast cycles with clear scope and review
1. **No system without a steward** – Every platform, doc, and folder has an owner
1. **Foundational before flashy** – Infrastructure wins long-term
1. **Ops = Culture** – How we operate *is* how we build culture
