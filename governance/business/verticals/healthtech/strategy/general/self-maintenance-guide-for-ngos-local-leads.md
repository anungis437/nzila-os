| “Was anything confusing or frustrating?” | Flag prompt in Companion settings menu |

---

## 🔐 Field Privacy Guarantees

| Rule | Field Tip |
| --- | --- |
| No reflections are stored without consent | Look for “Memory On” badge — if off, nothing is kept |
| Memory wipes leave audit trail, not content | Track Event ID but not story content |
| Printouts should never include emotional data | Use log summary sheets, not user insights |
| Users can “start fresh” anytime | Always offer Reset Companion if unsure |

---

## 🚨 When to Escalate to HQ or Ethics Review

| Situation | Required Action |
| --- | --- |
| Companion misfire during trauma topic | Pause session, file Misfire Form |
| Reflection references wrong user or memory | Trigger Emergency Wipe + Ethics Review Log |
| Caregiver disputes consent record | Review ledger, flag for audit trail verification |
| Hardware fails completely | Mark kit as out of rotation, log damage ID |
| Device used for unintended purpose | Lock down Companion and notify regional admin |

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| Assign a “Kit Lead” per field site | Reduces confusion, builds local expertise |
| Log all offboarding, memory wipes, and kit redeployments | Maintains full device and user traceability |
| Keep one printed Maintenance Pack per location | Offline readiness |
