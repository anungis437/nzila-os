# 🔁 Content Deployment Pipeline + Approval Gates

**Owner:** Aubert

This pipeline ensures that **every word, visual, tone, and interaction** released to the field undergoes **controlled progression**, is aligned with **Nzila’s trauma-aware design principles**, and is protected by **cross-functional approval gates**. It unifies content integrity across Companion modules and products while scaling safely across languages, demographics, and deployment zones.

---

## 🧭 Why It Matters

- Maintains **emotional, cultural, and regulatory safety** at scale
- Ensures **role-based collaboration** across studios, ethics leads, localization teams, and QA
- Prevents unvetted content from reaching users in sensitive cognitive or emotional states
- Aligns with audit-ready governance and **memory-aware UX flows**
- Guarantees **each deployment has traceable consent, tone, and ethical alignment**

| 4️⃣ Localization & Accessibility Pass | Translated, adapted, and UX-access checked | Localization + A11y Leads |
| 5️⃣ Companion Voice Simulation | Tested in Companion rendering environment | Behavioral QA |
| 6️⃣ Governance Approval Gate | Consent flow verified, memory compliance logged | Governance Ops |
| 7️⃣ Deployment Staging | Assigned to product build or field-ready kit | Deployment Ops |
| 8️⃣ Live Deployment | Content activated via sync or offline bundle | Field or Auto Rollout |
| 9️⃣ Post-Deployment Monitoring | Field data and misfire flags logged and reviewed | Product QA & Ethics |
