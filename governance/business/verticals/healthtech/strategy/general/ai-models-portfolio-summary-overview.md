# 🧾 AI Models Portfolio – Summary Overview

**Owner:** Aubert

> “A portfolio is not just what we build with — it’s what we trust to scale.”

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This page summarizes Nzila’s production-grade AI Models Portfolio within the AI & Cognitive Systems Studio. Each model has been fully validated across:
- Consent-bound memory use
- Persona tone safety
- Prompt routing compatibility
- Governance and fallback protocols

---

### 📦 Included Models

| Model Name | Domain | Status | Memory Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Memora AI** | Cognitive wellness + reflection | ✅ Deployed | User + Session |
| **MyLearning AI** | Youth-focused adaptive learning | ✅ Deployed | Session (Guardian) |
| **NeuroBridge Engine** | Dementia-friendly speech comprehension | ✅ Pilot | Ambient + Session |

Each model is mapped to companion constraints, fallback routes, and memory control layers.

---

### 🔗 Key Artifacts

- ✅ **Model Deployment Playbooks**
- ✅ **Companion–Model Mapping Table**
- ✅ **LLM Provider Evaluation Matrix**

These define:
- Real-time deployment readiness
- Fallback safety and consent logging
- Which companions may access which model, and under what conditions

---

### 🧭 Strategic Capabilities

| Capability | Portfolio Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Tone Governance** | All models pass persona-calibrated simulation thresholds |
| **Memory Control** | No model permits unsanctioned data retention or cross-session use |
| **Fallback Routing** | Each model mapped to safe-mode companions and failure protocols |
| **Bias/Audit Safeguards** | Regular hallucination scan, tone validation, and compliance reviews |

---

### 🚧 Expansion Roadmap

- **ElderCare AI**: Extend Memora + NeuroBridge blend for aging populations
- **Multilingual Prompting**: Expand en/fr support for learning + journaling
- **Crisis-Aware Routing**: Overlay models with red-flag prompt detection logic
