# 🧾 Multimodal Interaction Layer – Summary Overview

**Owner:** Aubert

> “Multimodality is not an interface — it’s an experience contract.”

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This summary closes the final segment of the AI & Cognitive Systems Studio by detailing how CareAI governs interaction across voice, touch, gesture, and screen-based modalities. It ensures all interfaces:
- Respect tone and pacing constraints
- Operate under real-time consent logic
- Support accessibility and failover defaults

---

### 🔗 Key Segment Pages

### 1. **Multimodal Interaction Layer**

- Core framework governing input/output across sensory channels
- Session-bound fallback defaults for all device categories

### 2. **Accessibility Mapping Matrix**

- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant
- Touch size, alt text, screen reader labeling, motion toggle rules
- Persona-specific accommodations (youth, neurodivergent, crisis)

### 3. **Voice/Touch/Gesture Consent Extensions**

- Session-only defaults for voice/gesture
- Upgrade paths for persistent memory use
- Feedback UX and input logging for auditability

### 4. **Multimodal Prompt Compatibility Model**

- Prompt structure rules by modality (voice, display, gesture, kiosk)
- Truncation, pacing, fallback visuals, and tone consistency
- Memory and gamification safety gates per modality and consent status

### 🧭 Strategic Outcomes

| Value | Delivered Through |
| --- | --- |
| **Empathy** | Prompt tuning to respect user pace, tone, and physical interaction |
| **Integrity** | Consent upgrade logic across non-text inputs |
| **Accessibility** | Native compliance across all modalities and UX states |
| **Sustainability** | Scalable for future device types (AR, embedded, shared public) |
