## 🧭 Nzila R&D Innovation Lens

**Version 2.0 – Strategic Framing for 2025–2028**

### 🧠 **Purpose**

Nzila’s R&D is built around one core truth: **innovation is only meaningful when it reduces friction, amplifies dignity, or unlocks access.**

This lens ensures we **fund, prototype, and scale** only what fits our mission of **empathetic, equitable, and evidence-informed care technology**.

---

### 🔹 Guiding Principles

| Principle | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Human Impact First** | Innovation must measurably improve life for a caregiver, patient, or clinic. |
| **Non-Trendy by Design** | We solve neglected pain points — not chase hype. |
| **Minimum Viable Wisdom** | Fast prototypes, rich learnings. Fewer bets, smarter returns. |
| **Interdisciplinary Always** | Tech + clinical + emotional lenses co-lead every R&D effort. |
| **Compliance Isn’t Cosmetic** | We embed governance from first commit to final rollout. |

---

### 🧠 3-Lens Evaluation Framework

Nzila uses a triage model to score and filter all potential R&D work:

| Lens | Questions Asked | Required to Proceed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔧 **Utility Lens** | Will this reduce burden? Create value within 60 days of launch? Integrate into real workflows? | ✅ |
| ⚖️ **Ethical Lens** | Does it respect consent, explainability, autonomy? Are risks auditable and user-controlled? | ✅ |
| 🧩 **Strategic Lens** | Does it fit our Companion-centered model? Strengthen our IP base? Unlock future revenue or defensibility? | ✅ |

Only concepts meeting **all three** move to R&D Scoping.

### 🧪 R&D Lifecycle at Nzila

| Phase | Description | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Discovery & Backlog** | Ideas from feedback, founders, grant calls | Notion log + hypothesis |
| **2. Lens Evaluation + Scoring** | 3-lens scorecard + team alignment | Go/No-Go Sheet |
| **3. Prototype Sprint** | ≤ 4-week build, design, or narrative | Demo + QA-ready output |
| **4. Validation** | Clinic/caregiver/user testing | Usage data + qualitative reports |
| **5. Integration Planning** | If validated: roadmap entry + sprint breakdown | Sprint ticketing + rollout spec |

---

### 🧩 Domains We Prioritize

| Domain | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Adaptive Companions** | Build trust, behavioral intelligence, and ongoing engagement |
| **Game + Mood Loops** | Offer meaningful, lightweight interaction without cognitive drain |
| **Caregiver Support Tools** | Directly address burden, emotion, and coordination gaps |
| **Privacy-Safe Data Exchange** | Enable cross-stakeholder insight without overreach |
| **EHR-Agnostic Clinic Interfaces** | Add intelligence without disrupting clinical infrastructure |

---

### 🔁 R&D Learning Loop (Cross-Venture)

Nzila treats R&D learnings as shared platform fuel:

| Origin | Informs |
| --- | --- |
| Companion tone tests | CareAI + Memora |
| Clinic feature feedback | ClinicConnect, Insight Dashboards |
| Consent UX trials | FamilySync, AI Core |
| Fatigue flags & usage data | Mood loop for WellLoop |

🧠 *No research is venture-specific. Everything gets re-fed into the architecture.*
