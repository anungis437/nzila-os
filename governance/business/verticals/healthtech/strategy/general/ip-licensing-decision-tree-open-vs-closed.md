# 🌳 IP Licensing Decision Tree: Open vs. Closed

**Owner:** Aubert

### 1. **Nature of the IP**

- **Is the IP a core business asset that drives differentiation?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Open IP**.

### 2. **Strategic Goals**

- **Are we seeking external collaborations, partnerships, or funding based on the IP?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Open IP** (promotes external engagement).
- **No** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.

### 3. **Market Control**

- **Do we want to maintain exclusive control over the IP and its commercial application?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Open IP**.

### 4. **Monetization Strategy**

- **Is the primary monetization model based on licensing or IP-based revenue generation?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Open IP** (open access for adoption and network growth).

### 5. **IP Complexity**

- **Is the IP highly specialized and difficult to replicate, making it a unique market differentiator?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Open IP** (lower protection need).

### 6. **Community Engagement**

- **Do we want to encourage innovation and adoption by external developers or companies?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Open IP** (supports open-source models or SDK APIs).
- **No** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.

### 7. **Long-Term Strategic Vision**

- **Is the IP part of a larger ecosystem where opening the IP can accelerate growth (e.g., API ecosystem, community-driven development)?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Open IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.

### 8. **Licensing & Compliance Concerns**

- **Do we need to enforce strict compliance or control over how the IP is used (e.g., data protection, ethical standards)?**
- **Yes** → Proceed to **Closed IP**.
- **No** → Proceed to **Open IP**.

### **Closed IP** – Use Case Scenarios

- **Examples:** Core proprietary algorithms, critical business models, certain AI systems.
- **Advantages:**
- Full control over usage, distribution, and licensing.
- High monetization potential through licensing agreements or direct commercialization.
- Retention of strategic advantage and market position.
- **Monetization Strategies:**
- Direct sales or licensing agreements.
- Revenue share or equity stakes in partner ventures.
- Patent or exclusive access contracts.

### **Open IP** – Use Case Scenarios

- **Examples:** Non-core tools, SDKs, public-facing applications, certain research outputs.
- **Advantages:**
- Promotes widespread adoption and network effects.
- Builds a community of external developers, partners, or contributors.
- Potential to create ecosystem value (e.g., APIs, platforms, open-source).
- **Monetization Strategies:**
- Freemium models, with paid tiers for advanced features.
- Commercial partnerships, where others use the IP within their own offerings.
- Crowdsourced development or contributions (e.g., through GitHub sponsorships).

### 🧠 Decision Summary

- *Choose **Closed IP** if:
- The IP is central to business differentiation.
- Control and exclusivity are priorities for strategic advantage.
- The IP requires strict compliance or confidentiality.
- *Choose **Open IP** if:
- The IP is part of an ecosystem or community initiative.
- Adoption, collaboration, and external development are key drivers.
- The IP's commercialization is based on a different business model (e.g., network effects, freemium, ecosystem-driven).
