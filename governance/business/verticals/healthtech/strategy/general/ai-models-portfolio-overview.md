# 🧠 AI Models Portfolio – Overview

**Owner:** Aubert

> “Each model is a pillar. Together, they are the foundation of CareAI.”

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This page serves as the entry point to the AI Models Portfolio within the AI & Cognitive Systems Studio. It organizes Nzila’s key production-grade model implementations, mapped to:
- Use case domains
- Companion integration
- Memory architecture
- Simulation and deployment readiness

Each model is linked to:
- CareAI orchestration layers
- Regulatory safeguards
- Companion tone and behavior constraints

---

### 📦 Core Models Tracked

| Model Name | Purpose Domain | Current Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Memora AI** | Cognitive health, wellness, journaling | ✅ Deployed |
| **MyLearning AI** | Youth learning and reflection support | ✅ Deployed |
| **NeuroBridge Engine** | Speech-to-thought modeling in dementia | ✅ Deployed (Pilot) |

> Each model is validated through simulation, governed by persona-layer constraints, and wrapped in fallback protocols.

### 🔄 Cross-System Integration Map

| Integration Area | Model Dependency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CareAI Orchestration** | All models | Tone, swap logic, and routing integrity |
| **Memory Framework** | Memora, MyLearning | Object schema and memory consent |
| **Gamified UX Layer** | MyLearning only (partial) | Game mechanics safe zones |
| **Multimodal Prompting** | Memora, MyLearning | Voice pacing and trust constraints |
| **Simulation & Testing** | All | Emotional, fatigue, and pacing validated |

---

### 🧪 Governance Alignment

All models are subject to:
- Simulation Suite Evaluation (per segment)
- Companion-Persona compatibility lock
- Bias & fairness validation
- Consent-bound fallback and memory scoping

### 🔭 Expansion-Ready Architecture

| Expansion Target | Model Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| **Eldercare AI** | Extend NeuroBridge + Memora hybrid |
| **Youth Cognitive Games** | Extend MyLearning with puzzle-driven LLM logic |
| **Bilingual Prompting** | Translate Memora + Learning models (fr/en) |
| **Clinical Risk Flags** | Create overlay for crisis signal interpretation |
