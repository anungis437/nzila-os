# 💬 Donor Impact Reporting Generator Guide

**Owner:** Aubert

This guide supports teams in generating donor-ready impact reports that balance **qualitative insight**, **quantitative outcome data**, and **community-authored narratives** — without compromising user privacy or ethical boundaries. Each section includes templates, redaction guidance, and storytelling scaffolds tailored to Memora’s core use cases.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Generator

- Showcase **real-world Memora outcomes** across emotional, educational, or cognitive domains
- Enable NGOs and clinics to share stories without risking **consent violations** or **memory misuse**
- Provide **donor-friendly dashboards** and **monthly/quarterly summaries** from the field
- Standardize reports across multiple deployments while leaving room for **local voice**
- Ensure every story uplifts the dignity of the user, **not extract their trauma**
