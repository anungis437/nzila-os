### 🎯 Purpose

This summary outlines the structure and responsibilities of the **Governance & UX System Logic** segment within the CareAI ecosystem. It consolidates all logic governing:
- Consent
- Prompt behavior
- Persona transitions
- Memory export
- Regulatory compatibility

This segment ensures all user-facing logic is:
- Explainable
- Auditable
- Legally defensible
- Ethically enforceable

---

### 📚 Key Components

- 📝 Consent Language Kit
- Reusable phrasing for all memory, mood, and gamified opt-ins
- Revocation, export, and deletion flows
- WCAG- and youth-ready phrasing standards

- 🗂️ Memory Export & Audit Rules
- User export formats (Plaintext, JSON, PDF)
- Admin audit trail access (logged and scoped)
- Retention and user-notification enforcement

- 🔄 Persona Swap Protocols
- All swaps are explicit and consent-driven
- No silent swaps allowed
- Session memory is wiped; user memory scoped and declared

- 🚦 Prompt Escalation & Safety Logic
- Four escalation levels: Rephrase → Simplify → Pivot → Suppress
- Triggers: silence, confusion, distress, risk
- No repeated prompts or pressured tone shifts

- 📋 Regulatory Compatibility Checklist
- Mapped to GDPR, Law 25, HIPAA, and youth privacy codes
- Validated at every milestone gate
- Includes consent, audit, erasure, and clinical role logic

- 🧭 Prompt Routing Table
- Maps prompt types to persona, memory access, and fallback trees
- Prevents tone mismatch, unauthorized memory use, and unsafe delivery

---

### ✅ Outcomes

- All UX systems can be audited, explained, and revoked
- Persona behavior is consistent with tone, authority, and memory rights
- Prompt delivery is safe, inclusive, and defensible
- Memory and gamified mechanics are strictly scoped by consent
