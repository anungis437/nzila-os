# 📅 Quarterly Planning Cycle

**Owner:** Aubert

### 1. 🎯 Purpose

Nzila’s quarterly planning framework ensures **company-wide clarity, momentum, and reflection** across all products (Memora, OptivaCare, CareAI) and shared infrastructure.

It blends **startup velocity** with **platform cohesion**, enabling every contributor to see how their work compounds.

---

### 2. 🧭 Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Platform-led, product-paced** | Strategy cascades from the Nzila vision; execution flexes per product maturity |
| **Transparency by default** | All goals, blockers, and progress are visible in shared workspaces |
| **Velocity over Vanity** | Outcomes matter more than cosmetic delivery or vanity OKRs |
| **Well-being is a constraint** | Planning avoids burnout and embeds sustainable pacing |
| **Close the loop** | Every quarter ends with retros, lessons, and system improvements |
