# 🧩 Unified Sales Strategy

**Owner:** Aubert

*“Technology with soul. Generational by design.”*

---

## 🛠 **Framework**

All strategies are anchored in Nzila’s principles:

| Core Value | Sales Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Empathy** | Products solve *real human pain*, not vanity metrics |
| **Equity** | Go where traditional tech won’t: low-bandwidth, overlooked users |
| **Innovation** | AI isn’t the pitch — what it *enables* is |
| **Trust** | Lead with governance, auditability, and cultural safety |
| **Continuity** | Offer paths that grow with the user, not churn them |

Sales efforts follow a 3-part arc:
- **Acquisition** (who and how we reach)
- **Engagement** (how we create trust and traction)
- **Conversion + Expansion** (turning use into partnership)

## 🔁 Flywheel Model

1. **Start with empathy**: Introduce the solution by **reflecting the user’s reality**
1. **Deliver one quick win**: A child reflects. A patient smiles. A caregiver feels seen.
1. **Let them personalize**: Companion skin, local prompts, session length
1. **Use insights to expand**: The more relevant we are, the more we retain
1. **Keep value visible**: Printables, text summaries, reflection journals
1. **Re-engage with respect**: Nudges are never punitive — they’re invitations

## 🧩 Conclusion

Nzila’s sales strategy is not built on funnels. It’s built on **familiarity**, **equity**, and **invitation**.

We don’t pressure people to use our tools —

we make them feel like they were designed *for them*.
