# 🗂️ Memora Deployment Console (Partner UX Wireframe)

**Owner:** Aubert

The Memora Deployment Console provides **authorized partner organizations** with a unified, ethical, and **region-tagged interface** to oversee device rollouts, memory management, kit rotation, user onboarding flows, audit logging, and offline deployment logistics. The console is designed to operate in **low-resource environments**, support **modular access levels**, and maintain full alignment with Nzila’s data ethics and clinical oversight standards.

## 🧭 Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Minimization** | No sensitive user content displayed or exportable |
| **Consent Governance** | All memory and user ID tracking governed by active caregiver/user consent |
| **Sovereign Infrastructure** | Regional storage + offline deployment support |
| **Auditability** | Every console action is logged with context, role, and timestamp |
| **Modular Permissions** | Role-based dashboards (Admin, Field Coordinator, Clinic Support, QA Reviewer) |
