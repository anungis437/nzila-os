# 🔧 Device Retirement / Decommission SOP

**Owner:** Aubert

This SOP governs the process of **retiring, repurposing, or disposing** of Memora Companion devices. It safeguards memory data, prevents unauthorized reuse, ensures environmental responsibility, and maintains **ethical audit trails** for all hardware transitions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure **zero residual user data** on retired devices
- Support **memory export, consent reconfirmation, or erasure** prior to decommission
- Maintain a complete **device lifecycle audit log**
- Provide clear workflows for **reuse, recycle, or destroy decisions**
- Support **field teams, clinics, and NGO partners** in both connected and offline settings

## 🛠️ Valid Retirement Triggers

| Trigger | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| 🧯 **Device Failure** | Unrecoverable hardware damage, battery failure |
| 📦 **End of Program Use** | Device completed its rotation lifecycle |
| 🧑‍⚕️ **Policy Update** | Hardware no longer meets compliance or software standards |
| 🔁 **Redeployment Shift** | Devices pulled back for imaging and new programming |
| 🧼 **Mass Memory Wipe Requested** | Full recall due to trauma event or caregiver policy |

---

## 📋 Pre-Decommission Checklist

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **User Offboarding Complete** | Graduation or opt-out logged |
| 🧾 **Memory Layer Actioned** | Exported, archived, or securely wiped |
| 🔒 **Device Lock Activated** | Companion disabled to prevent post-use memory logging |
| 📄 **Rotation + Retirement Log Filed** | Unified audit entry including device ID and reason |
| 🧠 **Consent Ledger Finalized** | All caregiver or program consents attached or sealed |

---

## 🔐 Data Erasure Protocol

| Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Full Memory Layer | Encrypted overwrite (3-pass or system factory reset) |
| Companion Logs | Metadata-only logs exported and redacted |
| Device Storage | Full wipe or device imaging with blank instance |
| Recovery Block | Device marked non-redeployable until audit cleared |

> ⚠️ All data erasure processes follow GDPR, Law 25, and Nzila Data Sovereignty rules.

## 🗃️ Device Retirement Log Format

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Device ID | MMR-TAB-09234 |
| Retirement Type | Recycled / Repurposed / Destroyed |
| Memory State | Wiped / Exported / Archived |
| Consent Audit Linked | ✅ Yes |
| Final Rotation ID | ROT-2025-Q3-041 |
| Technician ID | 403-Field-NGO |
| Physical Status | Cracked screen, no battery |
| Environmental Plan | Returned to HQ for e-waste handling |

---

## 🔄 Retirement Outcomes

| Outcome | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔁 **Repurposed** | Re-entered into rotation after full audit + imaging | SOP-005 redeployment prep |
| 🗑️ **Recycled** | Hardware disassembled or shipped to certified e-waste handler | Tracked via green compliance log |
| 🔥 **Destroyed** | Device physically destroyed (per policy) | Log entry + photo (if required by regulator) |
| 📦 **Warehouse Hold** | Quarantined until program review or future imaging | No user data must remain |

---

## 📦 Physical Handling Guidance

- All devices must be tagged with **retirement QR** or **serial-coded sticker**
- Use tamper-evident bags for high-risk or trauma-linked device returns
- Field kits must include **Decommission Request Form** with caregiver signature if applicable
- Devices held over 30 days post-offboarding must be reviewed for auto-wipe trigger
