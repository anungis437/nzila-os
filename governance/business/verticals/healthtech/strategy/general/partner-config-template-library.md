# 📂 Partner Config Template Library

**Owner:** Aubert

This template library gives each Memora partner — from community clinics to multinational NGOs — a set of **pre-built, customizable configuration templates** to guide deployment decisions around consent, memory, language, avatar selection, tone packs, reporting flows, and governance. It ensures all configurations respect **Nzila’s ethics architecture** while adapting to real-world diversity in context, need, and capacity.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Accelerate onboarding and reduce friction during deployment setup
- Ensure that all Companion behaviors are aligned with **local consent norms, trauma sensitivities, and cultural UX patterns**
- Provide **audit-ready documentation** of partner choices and system boundaries
- Empower partners to balance **impact, safety, and operational feasibility** without reinventing the wheel
