# 🎨 Tone & Avatar Library Expansion UX

**Owner:** Aubert

This system governs how Memora’s Companion avatar and tone libraries grow — ensuring that new personas, voice packs, and visual representations maintain the **calm, culturally grounded, and emotionally adaptive UX** Memora is known for. It supports user choice, regional customization, and trauma-aware UX flows while maintaining consent, auditability, and deployment governance.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

- Enable **avatar + voice expansion** across geographies, age groups, and use cases
- Preserve **emotional continuity** and **memory alignment** between interactions
- Balance **user choice** with ethical defaults (especially for minors and vulnerable populations)
- Govern the **design, testing, and rollout** of new avatar styles and tone packs
- Align visual and auditory identity with **Nzila’s intergenerational care model**
