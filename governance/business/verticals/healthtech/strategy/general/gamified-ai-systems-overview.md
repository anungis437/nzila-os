### 🎯 **Purpose of This Segment**

This segment defines how CareAI uses **game mechanics, motivational scaffolds, and reward loops** to support:
- Cognitive training
- Wellness adherence
- Learning retention
- Emotional resilience
- Daily check-in engagement
- Long-term behavioral nudging

It applies to products like **Memora**, **MyLearning Companion**, **Puzzle Loop**, and **Smart Habits**.

### 🔧 Structure

We’ll break this into five foundational subpages:

---

- 🧱 Game Design Framework
- Aligned to **Octalysis**, **Self-Determination Theory**, and **Adaptive Difficulty**
- Core mechanics: streaks, timers, journaling XP, growth rings, mood gardens
- Goal: Increase user **autonomy**, **mastery**, and **connectedness**

- 🧠 Cognitive Mechanics Library
- Reusable “game mechanics” as modular logic units:
- Progressive challenges
- Personalized reflection loops
- Unlockable support language
- Narrative journaling arcs
- Version-controlled and persona-scoped

- 🎮 Reward & Progression Models
- Types of rewards: Visual, verbal, conceptual (not token-based)
- Achievement types: Daily, thematic, resilience-based
- Feedback types: Immediate, delayed, contextual (never intrusive)
- Optional integrations: Companion voice evolves with progress

- ⚖️ Gamification Ethics Protocol
- No manipulation
- No urgency-based tactics
- All reward loops are opt-in and optional
- Emotional fatigue detectors built into pacing logic
- Companion tone must **never escalate pressure**

- 🧩 Gamification Persona Matrix
- Maps which mechanics are active per persona
- Prevents game mechanics from appearing in grief, emergency, clinical flows
- Also tags memory sensitivity and opt-in requirements
