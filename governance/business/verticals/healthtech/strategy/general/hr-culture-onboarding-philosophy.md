# 👥 HR Culture & Onboarding Philosophy

**Owner:** Aubert

### 1. 🧭 Purpose

Nzila is a **mission-led studio**, not a traditional company. Every contributor—whether founder, part-time designer, clinical advisor, or backend engineer—joins a shared commitment: to build ethical, AI-powered tools that empower caregivers, clinics, and communities.

This document defines how we **onboard, empower, and grow talent**—with clarity, kindness, and a commitment to long-term legacy.

---

### 2. 🌱 Cultural Foundations

Nzila’s internal culture is built around **precision, compassion, and co-creation**. These five traits define how we show up:

| Trait | What It Looks Like |
| --- | --- |
| **Care First** | We treat each other with the same empathy we embed in our Companion |
| **Documentation = Respect** | Writing things down saves time and builds clarity for the next person |
| **Builder Mindset** | Titles are light. Ownership is active. We value action and learning. |
| **Asynchronous by Default** | We respect time zones, brainwaves, and bandwidth |
| **Feedback as Fuel** | We give thoughtful, kind input—early and often |

---

### 3. 🛬 Onboarding Philosophy

Every new contributor is treated as a **co-founder of their lane**. Onboarding is not an HR formality — it’s a design process.

| Principle | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Clarity before action** | Each role receives a scoped brief, onboarding doc, and intro call |
| **Context is a gift** | You’ll have access to product histories, Notion wikis, and strategy docs |
| **Early check-ins, not performance reviews** | We meet at Day 3 and Week 2 to align expectations |
| **You grow, we adapt** | Scope can evolve as you do — nothing is locked in |

---

### 4. 🔧 What You Receive

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Personalized Onboarding Doc (Notion)** | Key tools, goals, access links, timelines |
| **Project Brief / SOW** | Clear deliverables, outcomes, and collaborators |
| **Account Setup** | Gmail/Slack, Figma, Notion, Drive, QuickBooks (if applicable) |
| **Legal Readiness** | NDA + IP Agreement signed before access |
| **Nzila Wiki Access** | Company vision, product overviews, tone docs, Companion Manifesto |

---

### 5. 🚀 First 30 Days: What to Expect

| Timeframe | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| **Days 1–3** | Access complete, onboarding doc reviewed, intro call with Aubert |
| **Week 1** | First small task delivered or Phase 1 of project begun |
| **Week 2** | Check-in: roadblocks, feedback, growth targets |
| **Day 30** | Reflection: what’s working, where you want to go next |

> ✍️ We co-design your growth path — no career ladders, only platforms.

### 6. 🧑‍💻 Team Types at Nzila

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Core Team (Founders, CxOs)** | Drive studio vision, manage cross-product ops |
| **Contributors (FTE or PT)** | Designers, devs, writers, product — scoped or ongoing |
| **Specialists / Contractors** | Hired for project outcomes (UX, infra, illustration, legal) |
| **Advisors / Partners** | Strategic support, often equity- or royalty-based |

✅ *Everyone is a stakeholder — roles may shift, titles may not matter.*

### 7. ✉️ Communication Channels

| **Slack / Gmail** | Light comms, daily ops, async check-ins |
| **Docs / Sheets / Figma** | Project delivery + collaborative builds |
| **Brevo** | Partner comms and clinic engagement blasts |
