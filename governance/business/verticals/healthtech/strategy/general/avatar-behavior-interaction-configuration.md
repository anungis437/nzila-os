### **🧠 Emotional Intelligence Framework**

**Overview**

Avatars must recognize and respond to **user emotions** in a way that is **supportive** and **contextually relevant**. This section outlines how avatars can be emotionally intelligent by **understanding user emotions** and adapting their responses accordingly.

### **Key Elements:**

- **Emotion Recognition**

Avatars must detect **emotional cues** from users, including **verbal** (e.g., tone of voice, speech patterns) and **non-verbal** signals (e.g., facial expressions, body language). Avatars should be able to identify **frustration**, **happiness**, **confusion**, and **calmness**.
- **Emotion-Based Responses**

After recognizing a user’s emotion, avatars must respond with **appropriate actions**. For example, a **frustrated user** may receive **reassurance** or **simplified guidance**, while a **happy user** could be met with **praise** and **motivation**.
- **Tone Modulation**

Adjust the **tone** of the avatar’s voice based on **emotional context**. For example:
- **Calm tone** for stressed or frustrated users.
- **Cheerful tone** for users who are happy or motivated.
- **Reassuring tone** for users facing challenges or confusion.
- **Contextual Emotional Adaptation**

The avatar should adapt not only to the user’s emotions but also to the **situation**. This allows for seamless interactions that feel **genuine** and **empathetic**.

### **Customization Options**:

- **Emotion Recognition Settings** to control **sensitivity** to emotional cues.
- **Response Frameworks** for how avatars should respond to specific emotional triggers (e.g., **verbal encouragement**, **gentle reassurances**).

### **🗣️ Interaction Styles**

**Overview**

This section focuses on how avatars should interact with users, ensuring the style of communication is **appropriate** for the context and **personalized** to the user’s needs. Interaction styles must adapt to **user engagement levels**, **cognitive abilities**, and **preferences**.

### **Key Elements:**

- **Tone of Voice**

The avatar’s **tone** should vary based on user context. For instance:
- **Soothing tone** for healthcare or cognitive care contexts.
- **Energetic tone** for educational or gamification contexts.
- **Non-Verbal Communication**

Avatars with **visual representations** must convey emotion through **body language**, **gestures**, and **facial expressions**. This includes **smiling**, **eye movements**, or **leaning forward** to express **engagement** and **empathy**.
- **User Engagement Levels**

Avatars should adjust their level of **interaction** based on the user’s **engagement**. For example:
- A **highly engaged user** may require **less guidance**, while a **low engagement user** needs **more prompting** and **support**.
- **Active vs. Passive Interaction**

Some users may prefer avatars to take a more **active role** in guiding them, while others prefer a **passive approach**. Avatars must detect and adjust to these preferences, offering **independent interaction** or **more structured guidance**.

### **Customization Options**:

- **Tone Selector** to adjust avatar communication style (e.g., **formal**, **informal**, **soothing**, **motivational**).
- **Non-Verbal Cues** to enhance emotional connection with **eye movements**, **body language**, and **facial expressions**.
- **Interaction Mode** options, letting studios configure how avatars interact based on user preferences (e.g., **passive**, **active**, **encouraging**).
