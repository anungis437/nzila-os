# 🤝 Social Impact Strategy

**Owner:** Aubert

### 1. **Purpose**

Nzila’s Social Impact Strategy defines how we **embed equity, access, and measurable community value** into the core of each venture — not as a CSR add-on, but as a **product principle** and **governance priority**.

---

### 2. **Strategic Objectives**

- 🌍 Deliver tools that **reduce inequity** in care, education, and cognitive health
- 🤝 Ensure **co-creation with marginalized groups**, not just service to them
- 🧠 Prioritize products that **enhance dignity, autonomy, and well-being**
- 📊 Measure social outcomes as rigorously as financial ones
- 📣 Use platform visibility to **advocate for systems change** in digital health and learning

---

### 3. **Theory of Change**

**If** Nzila builds AI-enabled platforms with empathy, ethics, and equity embedded at every stage,

**then** caregivers, patients, learners, and frontline communities will experience improved outcomes, increased autonomy, and greater inclusion in digital futures.
