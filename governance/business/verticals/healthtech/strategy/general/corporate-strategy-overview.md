### 🔹 1. Mission

**Nzila Ventures** is a **venture studio and ethical IP-holding company** advancing human-centered solutions in **care, cognition, learning, and equity**.

We build and back ventures that:
- Tackle structurally underserved or stigmatized domains through design-first innovation
- Centralize IP, ethics, and AI accountability at the studio level
- Grow **milestone by milestone**, with fiscal discipline and embedded impact strategy
- Combine **commercial viability** with **governance-readiness** from day one

Nzila believes the future of equitable technology must be built **intentionally**, not opportunistically.
