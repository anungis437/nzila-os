# 🧱 Regional Language Expansion Plan & Translation QA Flow

**Owner:** Aubert

This plan governs how new languages are introduced into Memora’s Companion ecosystem — from dialect selection and vocabulary framing to **QA safeguards**, **translation memory management**, and **local review cycles**. It ensures translations go beyond direct word conversion and instead reflect **cultural nuance, emotional tone, and trauma sensitivity**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Ensure **accurate, context-aware translations** of Companion UX and content
- Localize reflective prompts, memory scripts, and tone cues for **each supported region**
- Maintain **emotional integrity** across languages, especially in trauma-sensitive flows
- Deploy multilingual Companion experiences that feel **native, not adapted**
- Provide tools and templates to manage **expansion, review, and improvement** across field environments
