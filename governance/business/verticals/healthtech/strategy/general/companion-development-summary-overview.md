# 🧾 Companion Development – Summary Overview

**Owner:** Aubert

> “Each persona is engineered. Each behavior is accountable.”

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This summary page provides an enterprise-ready, Notion-indexed overview of the full **Companion Development** segment within the CareAI platform. It centralizes all architectural, behavioral, compliance, and lifecycle protocols that govern companion creation, testing, and deployment.

### 🧬 Core Pages & Functions

### 1. **Companion Design Framework**

Defines the structure of a persona:
- Tone, empathy, memory access, gamification role
- Fallback logic and crisis behavior
- Persona swap permissions and audit traceability

### 2. **Persona Calibration Toolkit**

Validation suite for:
- Tone stress testing
- Empathy simulation
- Pacing, memory, and fallback logic
- Prompt compatibility across libraries

### 3. **Companion Use Case Templates**

Deployment-ready profiles including:
- Target environments (clinical, wellness, youth, shared device)
- Consent model and memory scope
- Persona + gamification matrix
- Swap, crisis, and fallback behaviors

### 4. **Lifecycle Management Protocols**

Operational governance for:
- Draft → Calibrated → Live → Deprecated → Retired states
- Version control, change logging, and audit requirements
- Recalibration triggers and memory cleanup logic

### 5. **Companion Identity Ledger**

Live registry of all personas, including:
- Tone signature, empathy profile, authority level
- Deployment status, memory rights, gamification flags
- Last calibration, audit trail, and retirement status
