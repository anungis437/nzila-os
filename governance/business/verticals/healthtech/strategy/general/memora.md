# Memora

**Owner:** Aubert

*“Care that remembers.”*

Memora is Nzila’s flagship HealthTech product — an **AI-powered Companion system** designed to support aging minds with dignity, calm, and cultural care.

It offers memory-aware engagement, emotional resilience tracking, and daily routines that **listen**, **learn**, and **uplift**.

Whether deployed in clinics, homes, or care networks, Memora serves as a bridge between patients, caregivers, and clinicians — with **zero surveillance**, **full consent routing**, and **offline resilience** built-in.
