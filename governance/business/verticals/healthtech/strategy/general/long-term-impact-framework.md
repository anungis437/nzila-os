# 📊 Long-Term Impact Framework

**Owner:** Aubert

Memora is designed for **emotional resilience**, **cognitive scaffolding**, and **trust-based engagement** — not just content delivery. This framework enables funders, NGOs, caregivers, and governments to evaluate outcomes over **months or years**, even in **offline or hybrid deployments**.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- Measure **emotional growth**, not just academic progress
- Track **care engagement patterns**, not surveillance metrics
- Respect privacy while enabling **longitudinal insight**
- Equip field partners to report **real-world impact to funders**
- Inform product improvements based on lived usage over time

## 🧭 Evaluation Pillars

| Pillar | Sample Indicators | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧠 **Cognitive Resilience** | Reflection quality, topic variation, curiosity tone | Companion logs (consented) |
| 💬 **Emotional Self-Awareness** | Mood variation tracking, naming emotions, journaling presence | Reflection prompts |
| 🪞 **Self-Expression Growth** | Shift from emoji to narrative response, new word adoption | Linguistic session data |
| 🤝 **Caregiver Engagement** | CoPilot activity, consent revision frequency, rest-mode use | Metadata + caregiver log |
| 📈 **Session Patterns** | Daily/weekly use trends, dropout points, fatigue flags | Companion interaction data |
| 📋 **Re-entry & Retention** | Return rate, duration before relaunch, graduation outcomes | Re-entry IDs |
| 🌍 **Equity of Access** | Offline kit usage, multilingual reflection ratio | Field logs, deployment metadata |

## 🔍 Measurement Model

Memora uses a **mixed-methods impact model**:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 📱 **Quantitative Session Metadata** | Mood check-ins, usage timestamps, journaling flags |
| 📝 **Qualitative Field Notes** | Caregiver reflections, staff observations, cultural variations |
| 🔁 **Longitudinal Reconnects** | If user returns, behavior delta measured |
| 🧾 **Memory Evolution Logs** | Change in saved topics, voice tone shifts, emotional range |
| 💬 **Caregiver Survey Cards** | 3-month / 6-month follow-up (paper or oral) |
| 🛖 **Partner Impact Reports** | Clinics or NGOs complete quarterly outcome briefs |

---

## 📅 Impact Cadence

| Milestone | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 **Day 0** | Baseline mood + reflection snapshot (first Companion use) |
| 📆 **Day 30** | First trend summary auto-generated (if device connected) |
| 🔄 **Quarterly** | Optional field check-in + Partner Report |
| 🎓 **At Graduation** | Final memory export + emotional growth visualization |
| 🌀 **Re-Entry** | Compare prior Companion behavior to new one (delta analysis) |

---

## 🔒 Privacy-Respecting Logic

- **Opt-in only**: No long-term metrics are tracked unless caregiver consents
- **Local-first**: Impact logs can remain offline; export only with consent
- **Audit trails**: All memory usage and analytics can be traced and reviewed
- **Erasure path**: Users can graduate and erase all data anytime
