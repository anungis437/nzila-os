# EDTECH STUDIO

**Owner:** Aubert

*“Learning that remembers.”*

Nzila’s EdTech Studio creates tools for learners often overlooked by mainstream systems — kids with no devices, limited hours, or cultural disconnects.

We design **offline-first**, **emotionally aware**, and **culturally grounded** platforms that meet youth where they are — and grow with them.

Current Projects:
- 🔴 **MyLearning Companion**: A memory-aware AI guide for reflection, resilience, and personalized learning
- 📕MyLearning Companion
- ✏️ **Offline EdTech**: Preloaded kits and deployment models for homes, clinics, and field programs
- 📏Offline EdTech
- 🕹 **EdTech Games Library**: A collection of cognitive, story-based, and adaptive learning games
- 🎮EdTech Games Library

This studio focuses on **after-school learners**, **community programs**, and **caregiver-enabled journeys** —

not schools, but the spaces *just outside them* where real equity work begins.
