### 🔹 4. Key Assumptions

| Area | Assumption |
| --- | --- |
| **B2C CAC** | $9.25 average per user (social, org partners, paid ads) |
| **B2B CAC** | $1,800 per clinic (via pilot conversion flow) |
| **Churn (B2C)** | ~4% monthly (improves with streak gamification) |
| **Gross Margin** | 84% blended margin (cloud cost, support, R&D amortized) |
| **SDK Risk** | Unpredictable cadence, but 80–90% margin on delivery |

---

### 🔹 5. Strategic Insights & Levers

| Insight | Implication |
| --- | --- |
| **Clinic revenue is predictable** | Prioritize 6-month pilots with built-in conversion path |
| **B2C scales via networks** | Focus on Caregiver Org, Alzheimer’s Society, and church group funnels |
| **SDK offsets dev cost** | Reinvest SDK revenue into Companion updates or IRB prep |
| **25K subs = breakeven ops** | Hit by Q1 2027 with minimal B2B dependency if CAC is controlled |

---

### 🔹 6. Strategic Scenarios

| **Base Case** | 65% B2C, 30% B2B, 5% SDK | Current go-to-market plan |
