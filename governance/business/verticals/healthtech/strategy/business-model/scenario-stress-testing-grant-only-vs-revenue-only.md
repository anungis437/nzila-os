# 🧪 Scenario Stress Testing (Grant-Only vs. Revenue-Only)

**Owner:** Aubert

### 📊 Model Summary

| Parameter | Grant-Only Scenario | Revenue-Only Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Starting Capital** | $100,000 | $100,000 |
| **Monthly Costs** | $42K → $57K | $42K → $57K |
| **Grant Inflows** | $50K quarterly (Apr, Jul, Oct, Jan) | $0 |
| **Revenue Inflows** | $0 | Starts at $15K in Apr, grows to $70K by Mar |
| **Runway Exhaustion Point** | **August 2025** | **February 2026** |

---

### 🧾 Key Insights

### 🔹 Grant-Only Scenario:

- Temporary boost from quarterly $50K infusions
- Cash reserves go **negative by August 2025**
- Requires either **higher grant amounts** or **co-funding revenue** to maintain solvency
- **Not viable standalone** unless grant cadence increases or cost controls are implemented

### 🔹 Revenue-Only Scenario:

- Slow MRR ramp (from $15K → $70K/mo)
- Negative cash starts **February 2026** — 5 months later than grant-only
- Stronger **compounding return** on performance-based growth
- **Still requires supplemental capital or cost throttling by early 2026**

### 🔧 Strategic Recommendations

| Path | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Grant-Only** | Increase grant inflow to $75K/quarter or reduce burn by 15–20% immediately |
| **Revenue-Only** | Increase B2B onboarding speed or introduce caregiver co-pay to reach breakeven by Q1 2026 |
| **Hybrid** | Blend both paths for optimal outcome — see [Hybrid B2B2C Scenarios] for model options |
