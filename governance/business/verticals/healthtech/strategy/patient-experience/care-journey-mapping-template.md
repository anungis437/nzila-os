# 🗺 Care Journey Mapping Template

**Owner:** Aubert

This template allows Memora deployment partners to build **personalized or anonymized snapshots** of each user's care journey — turning mood logs, reflection types, memory settings, and Companion behaviors into **insightful, narrative-aligned pathways**. It is built to be used **offline or online**, and integrates with Memora's impact and data feedback frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Track emotional resilience and curiosity growth over time
- Enable caregiver or staff interpretation of changes in behavior
- Surface disengagement, rest phases, or trauma triggers
- Preserve memory sovereignty while building visual insights
- Equip funders and partners with **narrative-centered reporting tools**

## 🔒 Data & Consent Considerations
