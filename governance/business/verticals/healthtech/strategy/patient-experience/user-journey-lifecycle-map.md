# 🧭 User Journey Lifecycle Map

**Owner:** Aubert

This lifecycle map ensures Memora adapts to **changing needs, rhythms, and contexts** over time. Whether deployed in clinics, homes, or communities, Memora’s Companion evolves with the learner or elder — never static, never prescriptive.

It enables long-term alignment between:
- Companion memory behavior
- User emotion and cognitive patterns
- Caregiver control
- Impact measurement

## 🗺️ Journey Stages (Memora-Wide)

Each user flows through **one or more of these non-linear stages**, depending on age, deployment setting, and Companion tone configuration.

---

### 🟢 1. **Onboarding & Trust Building**

| Goal | Establish safety, tone, and identity |

| Companion Behavior | Gentle, repetitive, low memory |

| Caregiver Role | Sign consent, co-view early sessions |

| Tools | Welcome guide, avatar card, intro script, printed reflection log |

| Risks | Mistrust, silence, device avoidance |

| Mitigation | Visual prompts, audio welcome, skip memory features |

---

### 🟡 2. **Rhythm & Familiarity**

| Goal | Daily or weekly interaction with baseline engagement |

| Companion Behavior | Repetition + recognition of themes ("Last time, you…") |

| Memory Mode | Local-only; highlights without storing deep sessions |

| Reflection Used | Weekly mood check-ins, drawing prompts, emoji surveys |

| Caregiver Role | Optional CoPilot view, encouragement only |

| Tools | Mood journal, companion voice tweaks, fatigue flagging |

---

### 🟠 3. **Emotional Disruption / Reset Phase**

| Trigger | Missed sessions, fatigue, frustration, trauma resurfacing |

| Companion Behavior | Shifts tone, recommends pause, simplifies questions |

| Support Tools | Reset card, reflection-only mode, silent Companion mode |

| Caregiver Role | Activated for override, reassurance, pacing |

| Field Staff | Logs incident, uses recovery protocols |

> 📌 The Companion must never “push” a disengaged user. Rest is valid progress.

---

### 🔵 4. **Exploration & Personalization**

| Trigger | Trust established; user initiates sessions or asks new questions |

| Companion Behavior | Remembers preferred tone, themes, reflection types |

| Memory Mode | Session-based toggles; consent reaffirmed weekly |

| Feature Use | More open-ended journaling, cultural stories, goal scaffolding |

| Caregiver Role | May activate learning loops, request visual insights |

| Tools | Companion behavior tuning, reflection visualizer (paper or app) |

---

### 🟣 5. **Scaling or Aging Out**

| Trigger | Program ends, device is rotated, user ages into new mode |

| Companion Behavior | Begins “handover” behavior: summaries, closure rituals |

| Memory Protocol | Memory offloaded to secure printout or narrative bundle |

| User Options | Say goodbye, switch Companion, graduate to adult mode |

| Caregiver Tools | Memory archive request, new app referrals, feedback form |

> 🎓 A “goodbye” flow is as important as a “hello.” Closure matters.

---

## 🔄 Alternate Journeys

| Variant | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Short-Term Emotional Support** | 2-week clinic stay, grief support: skips to Reflection Mode only |
| **No Caregiver Available** | Refugee child on solo deployment: uses preapproved consent + tone lock |
| **Multi-Caregiver Households** | Tracks each adult’s memory permissions separately (local ID tags) |
| **Return User** | Reconnects with a familiar Companion from earlier deployment (with recovery memory) |

---

## 🔁 Companion Behavior by Stage

| Behavior | Onboarding | Rhythm | Disruption | Exploration | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Usage | Off | Local-only | Off | Selective | Export & erase |
| Voice Style | Soft, few questions | Gentle recall | Passive or pause | Responsive + curious | Soft closure |
| Reflection Type | Visual-only | Mood scale | Coping prompts | Journaling & dreaming | Gratitude, goodbye |
| Caregiver Sync | Required | Optional | Required | Optional + insights | Closure form sent |
