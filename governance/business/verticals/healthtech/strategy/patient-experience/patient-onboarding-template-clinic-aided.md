# 🧾 Patient Onboarding Template (Clinic-Aided)

**Owner:** Aubert

### 🧍‍♀️ 1. Who It’s For

> “Memora is for people who want to stay mentally active and feel encouraged in their day-to-day routines — especially those navigating memory changes, aging, or caregiving.”

This app is **not a test**, **not a diagnostic tool**, and has **no scoring or pass/fail**. It’s about keeping your mind engaged with light daily activities and having a friendly digital Companion by your side.

### 📱 2. What It Includes

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 **Cognitive Games** | Fun, no-pressure games that support memory, attention, and sorting |
| 💬 **Companion** | A friendly guide who offers encouragement and reminders |
| 👨‍👩‍👧 **Caregiver Option** | You can invite a family member to cheer you on if you want |
| 🏥 **Clinic Dashboard** | Your clinic can see general trends, but not your personal content |

---

### ✅ 3. Consent Summary (Plain Language)

Before we help you set up Memora, we want to make sure you’re comfortable with:

| Consent Area | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Using Memora** | You agree to use the app to engage with games and prompts |
| **Sharing with Clinic** | Your clinic can see how often you play, but not your game answers |
| **Linking a Caregiver** | You can choose to invite someone you trust — or skip it |
| **Keeping Data in Canada** | All your information is stored securely in Canada |
| **Stopping at Any Time** | You can pause or delete your account at any time — no questions asked |

---

### 🧑‍💻 4. Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

> Clinic staff may assist with steps if patient consents to tech support.
1. **Open the email from Memora and tap the link**
1. **Create a password and choose your preferred language (English or French)**
1. **Read and accept the short consent agreement**
1. **Begin your first session — Companion will greet you**

*Optional:* “Would you like to link a family member for encouragement?”

---

### 🔐 5. Privacy Reminders (To Reinforce Verbally)

- We never store your health or medical information
- You can mute the Companion or stop at any time
- Your clinic **cannot** see your exact gameplay — just how often you’re using it
- If you’re unsure, **you can say no**, and we’ll help explain again later

---

### 🗣️ 6. Sample Script (Clinic Staff)

> “Memora is designed to support your memory and well-being using light games and a kind, guided experience. We’ll help you set it up — and everything is optional, private, and reversible. If something doesn’t feel right, you’re always in control.”
