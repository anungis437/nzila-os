- **Cross-functional planning** (design vs. dev vs. compliance)
- **Post-MVP cost scaling decisions**
- **Investor use-of-funds slides**

All costs are expressed in **Canadian Dollars (CAD)**.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Most costly feature**: *Companion Logic Engine* ($44,500) — reflects advanced behavior rules, bilingual scripting, and audit trails
- **High compliance ratio**: *Consent & Privacy Infrastructure* — >45% of its budget dedicated to legal/privacy safeguards
- **Clinic deployment costs**: *Dashboard & data pipeline* combined = $56.3K — strategic for scaling and research partnerships
- **Low dev, high design features**: *Accessibility* and *Bilingual UX* emphasize Memora’s equity posture

### 🧠 Strategic Implications

- Use for **grant alignment** by tagging eligible cost types (e.g., CIHR’s “digital patient-facing tools”)
- Support **modular budgeting** for future pricing tiers (e.g., exclude research tools from baseline license)
- Inform **roadmap timing** — prioritize high-impact/low-cost modules (e.g., Reminder System) in constrained quarters
