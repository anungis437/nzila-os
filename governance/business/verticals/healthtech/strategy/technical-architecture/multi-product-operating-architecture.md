# 🏗️ Multi-Product Operating Architecture

**Owner:** Aubert

**Nzila Ventures | 2025 Edition**

---

### 🔍 Executive Summary

Nzila Ventures is a **mission-aligned, multi-product platform** supporting innovations across caretech (Memora, OptivaCare, NeuroBridge) and edtech (MyLearning Companion). Each venture addresses a unique need, but all benefit from a **shared operational spine** — enabling speed, scale, and trust without duplicating effort.

This document outlines the architecture, deployment, and governance principles that ensure all ventures remain secure, explainable, efficient, and user-first.

### 🧠 Architecture Model: *Shared Core, Modular Verticals*

| Layer | Description | Shared Across Ventures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Companion AI Layer** | Adaptive, tone-sensitive agent with long-term memory | ✅ Core to all ventures |
| **User Identity & Security** | SSO, multi-role support, caregiver linking, child/student modes | ✅ |
| **Data Privacy & Logging** | Consent workflows, PIPEDA/Law 25/GDPR compliance, audit logs | ✅ |
| **Analytics Layer** | Unified behavior tracking, adherence, engagement, and A/B support | ✅, with per-product filters |
| **Design System** | Shared UI kit (e.g., Memora UI → Optiva reuse); accessibility defaults | ✅ |
| **Clinic/Admin Interfaces** | Dashboards, flag logs, cohort management | Optional per venture |
| **Product UIs** | Distinct applications: Memora App, OptivaCare Portal, Puzzle Loop B2C | ❌ Venture-specific |
| **Gameplay & Learning Logic** | Cognitive modules, milestone engines, challenge pacing | ❌ Built independently but follow shared templates |
| **Family/Support Layer** | Caregiver messages, student guardian access, encouragement templates | ✅ Across health + edtech |

### 🧪 Environment & Deployment Strategy

| Environment | Description | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Staging** | Shared testing environment across all ventures | Central DevOps |
| **Production** | CI/CD pipelines deployed per venture (e.g., Memora ≠ OptivaCare) | Per-product team |
| **QA/Regression** | Shared Companion behavior validation suite | QA team with product input |
| **Data Lake** | Centralized storage with RBAC segmentation per venture | Strategy & Engineering |
| **Beta Channels** | Select ventures (Memora, Puzzle Loop) support opt-in pilot modes | Product-specific |

### 🧭 Summary

Nzila’s multi-product model succeeds because it is **purpose-built to balance stability and specialization**:
- We protect users’ privacy and time through unified governance.
- We reduce build time by sharing IP, design, and infrastructure.
- We scale trust by embedding empathy and explainability from Day 1.

Each venture builds boldly — but never in isolation.
