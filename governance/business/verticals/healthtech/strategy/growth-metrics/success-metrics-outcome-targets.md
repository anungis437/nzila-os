# 📊 Success Metrics & Outcome Targets

**Owner:** Aubert

### 🧠 **Principles Behind Our Metrics**

Memora does not define success by daily logins or time spent in-app. Instead, we track:
- **Sustained, emotionally safe use**
- **Relational consistency, not performance**
- **Support ecosystem alignment** (patient + caregiver + clinic)

These metrics support evaluations by:
- Clinics (pilot retention & adherence)
- Researchers (behavioral insight & fatigue response)
- Funders (impact reporting & ROI)
- Internal product teams (Companion tuning & feature roadmap)

### ✅ **Pilot & MVP Success Metrics**

| Domain | Metric | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Patient Engagement** | Avg. days of active use per 30-day window | ≥18 days, with ≥3 rest days included |
|  | % of users who accept rest day prompt at least once | ≥60% (fatigue adaptation acceptance) |
|  | % of users still engaged after week 4 | ≥70% retention with light or moderate use |
| **Caregiver Visibility** | Avg. caregiver view logins per week | ≥2 per active patient |
|  | % of caregivers who report reduced anxiety via post-pilot survey | ≥75% |
| **Companion Responsiveness** | Companion tone change based on usage data | ≥80% of cases trigger a correct tone mode shift |
|  | Companion rest-suggestion acceptance rate | ≥50% |
| **Clinical Insights** | Dashboard session access per week per clinic | ≥3 sessions/week/clinic |
|  | Clinician-reported usefulness of “soft adherence” metrics | ≥4.2/5 satisfaction (qualitative scoring) |
| **Compliance** | % of accounts with valid consent trail (Law 25) | 100% |
|  | % of users who opt into data sharing with caregivers | ≥85% (goal: trust through transparency) |

### 📈 **Post-Pilot / Public Phase Metrics**

| Domain | Metric | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product Health** | Churn rate <30% over 90 days | Maintain engagement with adaptive pacing |
| **Emotional Impact** | % of users who use the Reflection or Journal features weekly | ≥50% |
| **Care Ecosystem Growth** | % of patients linked with at least one caregiver | ≥80% |
| **Community Amplification** | Companion-generated “wellness note” shares (opt-in) | 10% month-over-month increase |
| **Scalability Signals** | Regional or network-level clinic adoption (pilot-to-license) | Convert 2 pilot sites to institutional license in 2026 |

### 🧭 **How We Will Track These**

- Embedded in-app data analytics with fatigue-awareness tagging
- Companion interaction logs (tone shifts, prompt acceptance, pauses)
- Monthly dashboard exports for clinic partners
- Caregiver and clinician surveys (pre/post pilot)
- Optional behavioral research tagging (de-identified)
