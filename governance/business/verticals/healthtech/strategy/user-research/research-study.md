**Owner:** Nate Martins

## About this project

The research study was initiated to gain a deeper understanding of customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Feedback from customers indicated that there were some areas of our product and service that could be improved to better meet their needs. 

The research team is developing a survey to collect data from a representative sample of customers, which will be analyzed to identify patterns and insights. The goal of the project is to use the findings to inform strategic decision-making and improve customer satisfaction.
