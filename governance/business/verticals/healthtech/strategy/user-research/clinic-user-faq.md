# ❓ Clinic User FAQ

**Owner:** Aubert

### 🔐 **1. Access & Login**

**Q: How do I create my account?**

You’ll receive a secure email invitation from Memora. Click the link, create a password, choose your language, and accept the consent terms.

**Q: I didn’t receive the invite. What should I do?**

Check your spam/junk folder. If it’s still missing or expired, contact your Clinic Admin or Memora Support to resend it.

**Q: How long does my session last?**

You’ll be logged out after 4 hours of inactivity for security purposes.

### 👥 **2. Roles & Permissions**

**Q: What can I see as a Clinic User?**

You can see patient activity summaries: days active, average time played, Companion mute status, and whether a caregiver is linked.

**Q: Can I see individual scores or mistakes?**

No. Memora is not a diagnostic tool. Clinics only see aggregate engagement indicators—never detailed gameplay or personal content.

**Q: Can I reset a patient’s account or preferences?**

Only the patient can do that. If a patient requests assistance, guide them to their app settings or escalate to Memora Support.

### 📊 **3. Dashboard Usage**

**Q: What do the icons on the dashboard mean?**
- 📅 Calendar icon = streak count
- 🔕 Bell with slash = Companion muted
- 💬 Speech bubble = caregiver linked
- 🛑 Red highlight = consent revoked or user inactive

**Q: How often does the dashboard update?**

Once per day, at midnight local time. Real-time tracking is not available in MVP.

**Q: Can I export a report?**

Yes. Admins and Viewers can export a PDF summary of weekly engagement.

### 📋 **4. Consent & Privacy**

**Q: Are we collecting personal health data?**

No. Memora stores consent logs, game metadata (like streaks), and Companion prompt history—but not medical diagnoses or health records.

**Q: Can we use Memora without violating Law 25 or PIPEDA?**

Yes. Memora’s system was built to comply with Canadian privacy law, with explicit consent, localized storage, and user-controlled access.

**Q: What happens if a patient revokes consent?**

Their data is removed from the dashboard view. Their account remains usable from the patient side unless deleted.

### 🧰 **5. Support & Troubleshooting**

**Q: Who do I contact for technical issues?**
- For login/account issues: Contact your **Clinic Admin**
- For system bugs or questions: Email **support@memora.clinic**

**Q: What if a patient is confused or needs help with the app?**

Use the patient onboarding script or provide them with the Caregiver/Patient FAQ. Do not attempt to troubleshoot from your dashboard directly.

**Q: Can we request feature improvements?**

Yes. Use the feedback form provided after onboarding, or email feedback@memora.clinic with ideas or requests.
