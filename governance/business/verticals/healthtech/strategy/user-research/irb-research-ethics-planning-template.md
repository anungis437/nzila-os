# 📝 IRB / Research Ethics Planning Template

**Owner:** Aubert

This template provides a structured, modular framework for preparing a submission to an **Institutional Review Board (IRB)** or **ethics committee**. It reflects Memora’s architecture, privacy guarantees, consent mechanisms, and trauma-aware design — enabling transparent, defensible studies across clinical, caregiving, or educational environments.

## 📌 1. Study Identification

| Field | Entry |
| --- | --- |
| **Study Title** | e.g., “Evaluating Cognitive Outcomes with the Memora Companion” |
| **Principal Investigator** | Name, affiliation, contact |
| **Collaborating Institution(s)** | NGO, clinic, school, or government entity |
| **Study Type** | Observational / Interventional / Mixed |

## 🧠 2. Study Purpose & Objectives

**What are you trying to understand, measure, or improve?**

Outline primary and secondary goals, aligned with Nzila’s care framework (e.g., emotional resilience, memory scaffolding, trauma recovery, educational progress tracking).

> Example: “To assess whether weekly reflective prompt use improves caregiver-observed emotional self-regulation in children aged 7–11 over 8 weeks in rural field settings.”

## 🛠 4. Intervention or Companion Use

| Component | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Companion Mode Used** | e.g., Youth Learning, Dementia Care, Trauma Recovery |
| **Memory Layer Status** | On / Off / Configurable by caregiver |
| **Tone or Language Customizations** | Describe dialect, affect tuning |
| **Offline Mode Usage** | Yes / No — if yes, describe adaptation methods |
| **Daily/Weekly Flow** | # sessions, average duration, reflective cadence |
| **Any Incentives?** | e.g., honoraria, badges, material tokens |

---

## 🧾 5. Consent Strategy

| Mechanism | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Type of Consent** | Verbal, written, digital (QR-based), progressive |
| **Consent Materials** | Attach caregiver script, plain language form |
| **Ongoing Consent** | Reconfirmation prompts, opt-out flows |
| **Memory Control Options** | Export / wipe / pause / shadow mode |
| **Special Populations** | Describe support for non-literate or cognitively impaired users |

> All Memora studies must respect opt-out by design, with no coercion or consequence.

## 🧘 6. Risk & Safeguarding Protocol

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Psychological Risk** | Companion misfire, overexposure to grief topics, tone mismatch |

| **Safeguarding Events** | Companion detects distress: trigger escalation flow |
| **Response Workflow** | Describe pause protocol, flag review, field intervention |
| **IRB Point-of-Contact** | Who responds to ethics alerts locally? |

---

## 🔐 7. Data Management & Privacy

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Type Collected** | Reflections, mood tags, engagement logs (no personal info) |
| **Identifiers Stored?** | Never — hashed IDs only |
| **Where Stored** | On-device encrypted first, synced regionally if applicable |
| **Duration** | How long data will be retained |
| **Access Control** | Role-based access, local NGO rights, no public exports |
| **Memory Review** | Caregiver/participant can request review, wipe, or export |

---

## 🧪 8. Monitoring & Ethics Oversight

| Area | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| **Monitoring Frequency** | Weekly check-ins, mid-study audit |
| **Ethics Committee Contact** | Local or global IRB representative |
| **Memora Support Access** | Who handles misfires, memory escalations? |
| **Participant Withdrawal** | Describe opt-out and data removal flow |
| **Audit Trail Maintenance** | How logs will be tracked and filed |

---

## 📝 9. Reporting & Publication Plan

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Dissemination Intent** | Internal report / peer-reviewed publication / funder brief |
| **Data Aggregation** | All reporting must be anonymized |
| **Return of Results to Participants** | Yes / No — if yes, how? |
| **Community Use** | How findings benefit the population served |
