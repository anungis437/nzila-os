# 🏆 Scoring & Feedback System

**Owner:** Aubert

The **Scoring & Feedback System** in **Memory Match** is designed to create a **positive, non-competitive environment** that encourages long-term engagement while promoting cognitive growth. The system prioritizes **supportive feedback** to enhance **self-esteem** and **motivation**, avoiding negative reinforcement that could lead to frustration or disengagement.

The design of this system aligns with **therapeutic goals**, focusing on **progress** and **achievement** without the pressure of “winning” or “losing.” It incorporates both **quantitative** and **qualitative** feedback to provide users and clinicians with insights into cognitive performance, ensuring that feedback serves as both an encouragement and a tool for improvement.

### 🎯 **Scoring Overview**

| **Metric** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Points** | Points are awarded for each **correct tile match**. Points accumulate based on the number of **pairs matched** and **rounds completed**. |
| **Tile Matches** | Each correct tile match contributes **one point**. Points are also awarded when **all pairs are matched** successfully, with bonus points for quick completion. |
| **Time Taken** | While there are no **timers** (to avoid stress), the time taken to complete each round is logged as **informational feedback**. |
| **Penalty-Free** | There are **no penalties** for mistakes, as the focus is on **cognitive development** rather than competitive scoring. |
| **Streaks** | Players are rewarded for **consecutive matches** and **consistent play**. For example, achieving a certain number of correct matches in a row can unlock visual or emotional feedback, reinforcing the user’s progression. |

### 🏅 **Feedback System Overview**

The **feedback system** in **Memory Match** is designed to be **gentle, encouraging, and reinforcing** progress rather than focusing on mistakes. This system aims to provide users with an emotional and cognitive boost throughout gameplay:

| **Encouraging Tone** | Feedback is delivered in a **gentle, calm tone** that is designed to reduce stress, using language such as *“Nice try!”* or *“Almost there!”* after mistakes. |
| **Soft Transition to Progress** | After each successful match or completed round, the feedback emphasizes **progression** rather than **completion**: *“You’re getting better at this!”*. This ensures the player remains motivated, even when encountering difficulty. |
| **Round Completion Feedback** | When all pairs are matched, the Companion offers **celebratory praise** (e.g., *“You did it! Well done!”*), followed by a gentle prompt to take a break or continue to the next level. |
| **Rest Prompts** | After several rounds, a **rest prompt** appears to guide the user towards cognitive breaks, reinforcing the game’s **fatigue-aware design**. *“Let’s take a short break! Ready to go again?”* |
| **Replay Suggestions** | If a user is struggling with matching pairs or the pace, the Companion offers **replay suggestions**: *“Let’s try a smaller grid to start”* or *“How about trying the ‘Animals’ theme again?”* |
