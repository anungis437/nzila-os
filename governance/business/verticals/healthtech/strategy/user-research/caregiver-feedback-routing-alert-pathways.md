# 📓 Caregiver Feedback Routing & Alert Pathways

**Owner:** Aubert

*“When care is shared, feedback must flow.”*

This page defines how Memora receives, interprets, and routes **caregiver input**, enabling the Companion to **learn**, **adjust behavior**, and **escalate** when necessary. Built for both **offline and online contexts**, the system honors emotional labor, respects user memory, and prioritizes safety without over-surveillance.

## 🧭 **Core Principles**

| Principle | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Respect Caregiver Insight** | All caregiver observations are treated as meaningful context, not override logic |
| **Memory-Aware Adjustment** | Companion adapts its tone, frequency, and routines based on family patterns |
| **Escalate with Empathy** | Alerts never shame or coerce — they *invite support* |
| **Consent-Governed Sharing** | All logs and summaries are caregiver-controlled unless emergency triggers activate |

---

## 🔄 **Feedback Channels**

| Channel | Format | Trigger Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **In-App Nudges** | 1–5 satisfaction rating post-session | “Did this help today?” |
| **Voice Memo** | Short voice input via parent app | “He got upset when it asked to journal.” |
| **Co-Pilot Annotation** | Editable timeline w/ symbols (mood, interruptions) | “Paused at 3 mins due to visitors” |
| **Printed/Offline Logs** | Field-formatted summary for weekly review | Used in low-connectivity pilots or print kits |

> All input types feed into a Companion Memory Summary Layer, which adjusts tone, timing, or skips features based on pattern recognition.

## ⚠️ **Alerting Logic (Non-Emergency)**

| Condition | Companion Action | Optional Alert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repeated stress signals during reflection | Pauses prompts for 3 days, suggests calming alternatives | Caregiver app notified |
| Sudden drop in engagement (>3 days) | Shifts to “gentle check-in” mode | Caregiver receives “Would you like to check in?” nudge |
| Contradictory emotional cues (e.g., happy face, distressed voice) | Logs uncertainty, flags for manual review | Appears in caregiver dashboard only |
| Feedback containing keywords (e.g., “angry,” “don’t like it”) | Companion softens next 5 sessions | Logged as tone flag |

---

## 🚨 **Escalation & Crisis-Adjacent Events**

| Trigger | Action | Caregiver Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Companion detects sudden disorientation | Pauses session, prompts caregiver check-in | Optional guidance shown |
| Voice command: “Stop. I’m scared.” | Companion shuts down, logs event | Alert pushed immediately |
| Repetitive unresponsiveness + flagged feedback | Triggers check-in protocol (“Should we pause use?”) | Can opt to pause Companion or request call from support org (if linked) |

> No automated escalation is sent to third parties unless caregiver explicitly enables escalation in consent settings.

## 🗂 **Caregiver Profiles & Routing Preferences**

| Preference Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Tone Sensitivity Setting** | Adjust Companion assertiveness based on family preference |
| **Alert Frequency** | Daily, weekly, or critical-only summaries |
| **Feedback Mode** | Emoji-only, voice, freeform text, or passive observation |
| **Log Visibility** | Set what logs are shared with other caregivers or professionals |
