### 🧠 Interpretation

- **Cost parity is tight** between B2C and B2B due to privacy and compliance costs being fixed across models
- B2B slightly higher due to **caregiver portal**, **clinic dashboard support**, and **shared admin costs**
- These values can guide pricing tiers (e.g., $9.99/mo B2C = 30% margin)
- Useful for **per-seat licensing tiers** in clinic pilots or advocacy-funded deployments
