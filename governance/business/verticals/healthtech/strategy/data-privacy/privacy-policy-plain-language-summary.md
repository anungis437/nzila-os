# 🔐 Privacy Policy (Plain Language Summary)

**Owner:** Aubert

We believe in **dignity-first design** — not surveillance, not profiling, not hidden tracking.

### **3. Who Sees Your Data**

| **Clinic (optional, pilot-only)** | Dashboard-level only (anonymized session count) |
| **Memora Team** | Minimal operational access, only if needed for support or bug fixes — always logged and encrypted |

---

### **4. Consent Is Central**

Memora is built on **consent-first architecture**. That means:
- You approve any caregiver or clinic connection
- You can unlink or disable access at any time
- You control whether your data is included in optional research
- You can mute the Companion or opt out of reminders
- You can delete your account permanently — no questions asked

🧾 Every consent action is logged and timestamped. You can view your history anytime inside the app.

---

### **5. Where We Store Your Data**

Your data is stored securely on **Canadian cloud infrastructure**, in compliance with data residency laws and research ethics.
- 🔒 End-to-end encrypted
- 🧩 Stored separately from personal identifiers
- 🔄 Reviewed for compliance annually
- 🗂️ All data access requires a purpose-tagged session (Law 25 audit ready)

---

### **6. Your Rights**

As a user, you have the right to:
- View, download, or delete your data
- Revoke caregiver or clinic access
- Disable the Companion or notifications
- Ask us what’s being stored — and why
- Refuse research participation without losing access

📧 Just email **privacy@memora.io** or use the in-app privacy settings to manage all of the above.

---

### **7. Research & Ethics (Optional Participation)**

If you choose to participate in research studies (e.g., via AGE-WELL, CIHR):
- You’ll be asked to approve participation via a second consent screen
- Your data will be anonymized before analysis
- No names, emails, or identifiers will ever appear in research outputs
- You can leave the research study at any time without affecting your app use

---

### **8. No Ads. No Surveillance. No Surprises.**

Memora has **no third-party ads**, does not sell your data, and does not use tracking SDKs for analytics.

We don’t use dark patterns.

We don’t nudge you toward things that aren’t in your interest.

We’re not here to trick you — we’re here to support you.
