# 🔐 Privacy Policy Summary (Clinic-Facing)

**Owner:** Aubert

### ✅ 1. Core Commitments

Memora is built on a foundation of **consent-first, role-restricted, and Canadian-hosted data privacy**. We ensure:

| Principle | Implementation |

| **Data Minimization** | Clinics only see what’s essential for engagement—not health data or gameplay content |
| **Consent-Driven Access** | Patients must explicitly enable clinic and caregiver visibility |
| **User Transparency** | Patients can see, modify, or revoke consent anytime |
| **Audit-Logged Views** | All dashboard views and role-based accesses are logged |
| **No Commercialization of Data** | Usage data is never sold or shared beyond permitted research partnerships |
