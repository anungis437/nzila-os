# 📝 Consent Language Kit

**Owner:** Aubert

> “Consent isn’t a checkbox. It’s a conversation.”

### 🎯 Purpose

This kit provides reusable, clear, and emotionally safe language patterns for all CareAI experiences that require user consent — particularly for:
- Memory usage (session, user, ambient)
- Gamified mechanics
- Progression tracking
- Personal data or preference retention
- Mood or emotional insight processing

All consent prompts:
- Must be plain language
- Must offer clear opt-out or deferral
- Must be reversible and visible
