# 🧭 Clinic Partnership Philosophy

Owner: Aubert

### 🎯 Purpose

Nzila Ventures partners with clinics not as “vendors,” but as **co-architects of better care**. Our philosophy is grounded in:

- **Reciprocity** — Clinics shape product evolution, not just adopt it
- **Ease** — No added burden; tools must fit existing realities
- **Respect** — Patient relationships and clinic expertise always come first
- **Impact** — Success is measured by reduced burden, improved adherence, and informed care

We believe **good digital health supports, never supplants.**
