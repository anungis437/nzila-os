### Competitor Weaknesses We Exploit

- **Wise**: Excellent for individual transfers, zero community features, no savings products
- **Remitly**: Higher fees on African corridors, no group financial tools
- **WorldRemit**: Declining market share, no innovation in community banking
- **Chipper Cash**: Africa-to-Africa focus, limited diaspora corridor coverage, regulatory challenges
- **Wave**: Mobile money focus in West Africa, no diaspora sender tools, no Canadian presence

## Unique Positioning

DiasporaCore is the **only platform** combining three financial pillars for diaspora communities:

1. **Remittances**: Low-cost, multi-corridor money transfers with real-time tracking
2. **Tontines (Savings Circles)**: Digitized traditional savings groups with transparency, dispute resolution, and automated payouts
3. **Community Banking**: Credit union-style services including micro-lending, group savings, and credit building for the unbanked

This triple integration creates **switching costs** competitors cannot replicate — users who manage their tontine, send remittances, and save through DiasporaCore have no single-platform alternative.
