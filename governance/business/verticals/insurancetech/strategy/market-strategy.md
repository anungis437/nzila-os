## Competitive Landscape

### Applied Epic (Dominant Incumbent)
- **Strengths**: 60%+ market share in Canadian broker management systems, deep carrier integrations, comprehensive workflow
- **Weaknesses**: Legacy architecture, expensive licensing ($500-1,500/user/mo), carrier-influenced roadmap, slow innovation cycle
- **Vulnerability**: Not designed for real-time multi-carrier arbitrage; quote comparison is manual

### Vertafore (AMS360 / Agency Zoom)
- **Strengths**: Strong US presence, modern agency management, good onboarding
- **Weaknesses**: Limited Canadian carrier integrations, US-centric compliance, weak CSIO support
- **Vulnerability**: Entering Canada without deep regulatory understanding

### Duck Creek Technologies
- **Strengths**: Cloud-native, carrier-side platform, modern API architecture
- **Weaknesses**: Carrier-focused (not broker-facing), expensive implementation, long deployment cycles
- **Vulnerability**: Does not serve independent broker distribution channel

### Guidewire / Majesco
- **Strengths**: Enterprise carrier platforms, claims and policy administration
- **Weaknesses**: Carrier-only focus, no broker tools, massive implementation costs ($5M+)
- **Vulnerability**: Irrelevant to independent broker workflow

### SentryIQ360 Differentiation
- **Multi-carrier arbitrage**: Neutral platform comparing 20+ carriers simultaneously — no carrier owns us
- **Broker-first design**: Built for independent broker workflow, not adapted from carrier tools
- **Real-time comparison**: Parallel API calls return side-by-side quotes in seconds
- **Affordable**: $99-799/mo vs $500-1,500/user/mo for incumbents
- **Canadian-native**: CSIO standards, FSRA compliance, provincial regulatory awareness built-in
