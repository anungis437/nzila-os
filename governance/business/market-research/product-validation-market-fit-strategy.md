# ✅ Product Validation & Market Fit Strategy

Owner: Aubert

### 1. **Purpose**

This strategy guides Nzila’s studios in systematically validating new products, features, and platform extensions. It ensures we ship only what’s:

- **Needed** (solves real problems for real users)
- **Usable** (fits workflows and behavior)
- **Desirable** (delivers user-perceived value)
- **Scalable** (can retain and grow its user base)

---

### 2. **Validation Framework**

Nzila applies a **3-stage validation model** across ventures:

| **Stage** | **Focus** | **Key Tests & Indicators** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Problem Fit** | Are we solving a high-stakes, urgent problem? | User interviews, pain signal intensity, willingness to switch |
| **2. Solution Fit** | Does the product work as expected? | Prototypes, usability tests, proof-of-value pilots |
| **3. Market Fit** | Is there strong demand and retention? | Activation rates, DAU/MAU, referral, NPS, qualitative “pull” |

---

### 3. **Core Tactics for Each Studio**

### 🧠 **CareAI**

- Validate with unpaid caregivers and frontline clinicians
- Use real-world **workflow shadowing + scenario simulations**
- PMF indicator: Reduction in cognitive or decision fatigue > 20%

### 💬 **Memora**

- Validate with seniors and neurodiverse users through **guided pilots**
- Assess **memory recall, engagement duration, and comfort**
- PMF indicator: ≥ 3+ weekly interactions sustained for 6+ weeks

### 🩺 **OptivaCare**

- Clinic pilots with tracked onboarding, **daily task integration**, and documentation compliance
- PMF indicator: ≥ 2hrs/week saved per staff, ≥ 80% workflow adoption

### 🧩 **PuzzleLoop**

- A/B test difficulty curves, rest cycle effects, and UX pacing
- PMF indicator: Session return rate > 40% after day 7, emotion tagging accuracy > 85%

### 🎓 **MyLearning Companion**

- Validate with families, afterschool programs, and low-bandwidth households
- PMF indicator: Active use by ≥ 2 family members in same household, offline mode usage > 50%

### 4. **Validation Tools & Methods**

| **Tool/Method** | **Use Cases** |
| --- | --- |
| **Customer Discovery Calls** | Problem discovery, early feedback |
| **Click-Through Prototypes** | Usability validation before backend build |
| **Job Stories + Journey Maps** | Understand emotional + functional triggers |
| **PMF Surveys (Sean Ellis Test)** | Quantify perceived value (i.e., “very disappointed” rate ≥ 40%) |
| **Pilot Scorecards** | Standardized tracking of adoption, usage, and pain relief |
| **Usage Telemetry Dashboards** | Real-time feature validation and drop-off analysis |

---

### 5. **Product–Market Fit KPIs**

| **Metric** | **Target (per product type)** |
| --- | --- |
| Weekly Active Users (WAU) | 30–50% of signups within 3 months |
| Retention at 30 Days | ≥ 40% (consumer); ≥ 60% (clinic tools) |
| % Users Referring Others | ≥ 25% for B2C; ≥ 1 org per 5 for B2B |
| “Very Disappointed” PMF Score | ≥ 40% |
| Time to First Meaningful Use | < 5 minutes |

---

### 6. **Iteration & Kill Criteria**

Nzila enforces a **disciplined iteration loop**:

- **If** PMF KPIs aren’t met after 2 pilot cycles or > 3 iterations,
- **Then**:
    - Pivot scope
    - Reframe the core problem
    - Or **retire the product** if validation consistently fails

This ensures capital and effort are reallocated toward ventures with measurable traction and transformative potential.

---

### 7. **Responsible PMF Practices**

- Never force engagement through manipulation (e.g., dark UX or anxiety-driven design)
- Always **return control to the user** (e.g., memory opt-outs, rest states)
- Consider PMF only valid if it **includes underserved users**, not just tech-privileged audiences
- Apply **privacy, consent, and ethics reviews** at every feature validation stage

---

### 8. **Governance**

| **Stakeholder** | **Responsibilities** |
| --- | --- |
| **Product Owners** | Own PMF for their venture, run discovery and testing cycles |
| **Venture Ops** | Track progress toward product KPIs and pilot success criteria |
| **Studio Leads** | Prioritize investments based on validation outcomes |
| **Board/Leadership** | Review go/no-go gates for major product launches or pivots |

---

### 9. **Conclusion**

Nzila’s approach to product validation protects what matters most: **user dignity, time, and need**. Every studio is expected to earn market fit — not assume it. This strategy allows us to scale responsibly, knowing our solutions are not just clever, but **truly needed, trusted, and wanted**.
