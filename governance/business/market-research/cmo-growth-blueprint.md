# 📈 CMO Growth Blueprint

Owner: Aubert

**Nzila Ventures – Growth Strategy (2025–2028)**

*“Earn trust. Enable behavior change. Embed in care.”*

---

### 🧭 1. Growth Vision

Nzila’s growth is **mission-aligned, ecosystem-aware**, and focused on delivering **measurable impact** — not vanity metrics.

We grow by:

- **Serving caregivers first**, not selling to them
- **Co-creating with clinics**, not extracting data from them
- **Positioning AI as support**, never replacement

**Bottom-up (caregivers) + Top-down (clinics) = Network-powered growth.**

### 🎯 2. Growth Objectives by Stage

| Phase | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| **2025 (MVP)** | Validate product-market fit; build waitlist + 3–5 pilot clinics |
| **2026 (National)** | Reach 5K caregivers, 25+ clinics, and publish 3+ case studies |
| **2027 (Expansion)** | Launch in U.S. via state-based pilots + 2 new products (CareAI, FamilySync) |
| **2028 (Platformization)** | Establish Nzila as a caretech ecosystem with cross-product retention |
