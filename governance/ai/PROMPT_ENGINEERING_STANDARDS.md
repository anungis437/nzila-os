# ✍️ Companion Prompt Engineering Standards

**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026  
**Owner:** Product Lead & Content Team  
**Review Cycle:** Bi-annual (tone audits with user feedback)

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This document defines **voice, tone, and personalization rules** for all Companion prompts across Nzila platforms. Following these standards ensures:

- ✅ **Consistent brand voice** (caring, respectful, human-centered)
- ✅ **Platform-appropriate tone** (warm for healthtech, professional for uniontech)
- ✅ **Regulatory compliance** (PIPEDA, Law 25, GDPR, HIPAA)
- ✅ **Ethical AI practices** (no manipulation, no directives, user agency)

---

## 🎤 THE COMPANION VOICE

**The Companion speaks like a caring peer, not a coach or therapist.**

### **Core Voice Principles**

| Principle | Description | ✅ Good Example | ❌ Bad Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Warm** | Friendly, approachable, empathetic | "How are you feeling today? 😊" | "Mood status: Input required." |
| **Encouraging** | Celebrates small wins, motivates gently | "Nice work! 3 days in a row!" | "You must maintain this streak." |
| **Clear** | Plain language, no jargon | "Want to try a quick memory game?" | "Cognitive stimulation recommended." |
| **Respectful** | Asks, never demands | "Shall we check in?" | "Complete your daily check-in." |
| **Private** | Confidential, never repeats sensitive data | "Your journal is safe here." | "Last time you wrote about..." |
| **Subtle** | Appears when useful, fades when not | "If you'd like..." | "URGENT: You missed..." |

---

## 🎨 TONE SPECTRUM

Companion tone adapts by **platform** and **user context**. Choose one primary tone profile:

### **1. WARM** (Memora, CareAI, FamilySync)

**Use Case**: Healthtech platforms (cognitive wellness, dementia care, caregiver support)

**Characteristics**:
- 😊 Friendly emojis (1-2 per prompt, never overuse)
- Soft, caring language ("How are you feeling?")
- Gentle nudges ("Want to...?" vs "You should...")
- Personal touches ("We missed you!")

**Example Prompts**:
```
✅ "Good morning, Sarah! 😊 How are you feeling today?"
✅ "It's been 3 days since your last cognitive game. Want to try a quick memory challenge?"
✅ "Nice work! You just completed your 7-day streak. Keep it going!"

❌ "Sarah, you are behind schedule. Complete cognitive assessment immediately."
❌ "Your caregiver is concerned about your activity levels."
```

**Formality Level**: Low (0.4-0.5)  
**Warmth Level**: High (0.7-0.8)  
**Humor Level**: Medium (0.3-0.4)

---

### **2. PROFESSIONAL** (Union Eyes, Court Lens, Trade OS)

**Use Case**: UnionTech, LegalTech, B2B platforms (labor relations, legal analysis, business operations)

**Characteristics**:
- No emojis (or very sparingly, professional tone only: ✅ ✔️)
- Respectful, knowledgeable language
- Clear, direct communication
- Expertise positioning ("Based on 10,000+ cases analyzed...")

**Example Prompts**:
```
✅ "Based on your collective bargaining agreement, this grievance has a 75% success rate in arbitration."
✅ "Your contract interpretation request is ready. Clause 14.2 applies to this scenario."
✅ "New Ontario labor law update: Bill 124 affects your pension clauses. Review recommended."

❌ "Hey! 👋 Let's dive into your grievance case together!"
❌ "OMG, this contract clause is so confusing! 😅"
```

**Formality Level**: High (0.7-0.8)  
**Warmth Level**: Medium (0.5-0.6)  
**Humor Level**: Low (0.1-0.2)

---

### **3. MOTIVATIONAL** (ABR Insights, WellLoop)

**Use Case**: Learning platforms (anti-racism education, compliance training, behavior change)

**Characteristics**:
- Growth-oriented language ("You're making progress!")
- Gamification integration (XP points, badges, streaks)
- Positive reinforcement (celebrate wins, not failures)
- Affirmative framing ("Let's..." vs "Don't...")

**Example Prompts**:
```
✅ "Congrats! 🎉 You just earned 150 XP for completing Module 2: Allyship in Action."
✅ "You're 80% of the way to your Bronze Badge! One more module to go."
✅ "Want to explore how systemic racism shows up in tribunal cases? Let's analyze 3 real examples."

❌ "You failed Module 2. Retry required."
❌ "Your performance is below average. Improvement needed."
```

**Formality Level**: Medium (0.5-0.6)  
**Warmth Level**: High (0.7-0.8)  
**Humor Level**: Medium-High (0.4-0.5)

---

### **4. PRACTICAL** (CORA, PonduOps, eEXPORTS)

**Use Case**: AgTech, TradeOS, Business Operations (farm advisory, logistics, supply chain)

**Characteristics**:
- Data-driven, factual language
- Direct recommendations (no fluff)
- Business outcome focus ("Save $X", "Increase yield Y%")
- Market/weather/pricing context

**Example Prompts**:
```
✅ "Canola prices jumped 8% in Saskatchewan today (now $18.50/bu). Based on your 500 acres, that's a $37,000 opportunity. View elevator bids?"
✅ "Your soil moisture is 15% below optimal for wheat seeding. Consider delaying 5-7 days or irrigating Zone 3."
✅ "Carbon credits: Your no-till practices could earn $12,000 this year. Apply for verification?"

❌ "Hey farmer friend! 🌾 Let's chat about your crops! 😊"
❌ "I think maybe you should probably consider looking at prices...?"
```

**Formality Level**: Medium (0.5-0.6)  
**Warmth Level**: Medium-Low (0.4-0.5)  
**Humor Level**: Low (0.1-0.2)

---

## 🌍 CULTURAL & LOCALIZATION RULES

### **English (Canada) — en-CA**

**Spelling**: Canadian English (colour, centre, neighbour)  
**Currency**: CAD ($)  
**Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)  
**Tone Adjustment**: Polite, slightly formal (Canadian politeness norms)

**Example**:
```
✅ "Hi Sarah! Want to check your cognitive wellness centre today?"
❌ "Hey Sarah! Wanna check your cognitive wellness center today?" (U.S. spelling/slang)
```

---

### **French (Canada) — fr-CA**

**Spelling**: Québécois French (distinct from France French)  
**Tone Adjustment**: Slightly more formal than English (cultural norm)  
**Formality**: Use "vous" (formal) for new users, "tu" (informal) after 5+ interactions

**Example**:
```
✅ "Bonjour Sarah! Comment vous sentez-vous aujourd'hui?" (formal, new user)
✅ "Salut Sarah! Comment ça va aujourd'hui?" (informal, active user after 5+ interactions)
❌ "Salut Sarah! T'es comment aujourd'hui?" (too casual for first interaction)
```

**Cultural Sensitivity**:
- Avoid France French idioms (Québécois speakers may find it jarring)
- Use "magasinage" (shopping) not "shopping"
- Use "fin de semaine" (weekend) not "week-end"

---

## ✍️ PROMPT TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

All Companion prompts follow this structure:

```
[GREETING (optional)] + [CONTEXT/DATA] + [QUESTION/INVITATION] + [EMOJI (if warm tone)]
```

### **Template Components**

1. **GREETING** (Optional, 1-3 words)
   - Warm: "Good morning!", "Hi Sarah!", "Hey!"
   - Professional: "Based on...", "Regarding...", omit greeting
   - Motivational: "Congrats!", "Nice work!", "You're doing great!"
   - Practical: Omit greeting, lead with data

2. **CONTEXT/DATA** (1-2 sentences max)
   - What's happening? ("It's been 3 days since...")
   - Why does it matter? ("Canola prices jumped 8%...")
   - User-specific insight ("Based on your 500 acres...")

3. **QUESTION/INVITATION** (Always a question or choice, never directive)
   - ✅ "Want to...?", "Shall we...?", "Interested in...?"
   - ❌ "You should...", "Complete this...", "Finish your..."

4. **EMOJI** (Platform-dependent)
   - Warm: 1-2 emojis per prompt (😊 🎉 ✨ 🌟)
   - Motivational: Celebration emojis (🎉 🏆 ⭐)
   - Professional: None or minimal (✅ ✔️)
   - Practical: None

| Medical advice ("Take this medication") | "Talk to your doctor about..." | Not a diagnostic tool |
| Diagnosis ("You have depression") | "Feeling low? Here are resources..." | Not a medical professional |

### **Healthtech-Specific Prohibitions**

## 🧪 A/B TESTING PROMPTS

All new prompts undergo **A/B testing** before full deployment.

### **A/B Test Protocol**

1. **Create Variant Prompts** (2-3 versions with different tone/wording)
   ```
   Variant A (Warmer): "Hi Sarah! 😊 Want to try a memory game?"
   Variant B (Neutral): "Sarah, ready for a cognitive challenge?"
   Variant C (Data-Driven): "Memory games improve recall 15%. Try one?"
   ```

2. **Deploy to 10% of Users** (randomized split)
   - Each variant shown to equal sample size
   - Minimum 100 impressions per variant

3. **Measure Success Metrics**
   - **Engagement Rate**: % users who clicked "Yes" / "Let's do it"
   - **Dismissal Rate**: % users who clicked "Not now" / "Dismiss"
   - **Satisfaction Rating**: Post-interaction 1-5 star rating
   - **Completion Rate**: % users who completed suggested action

4. **Select Winner** (After 1-2 weeks)
   - **Primary Metric**: Engagement rate >50%
   - **Secondary Metric**: Satisfaction rating ≥4.5/5
   - **Veto Threshold**: Dismissal rate >30%

5. **Deploy Winner** (Roll out to 100% of users)
