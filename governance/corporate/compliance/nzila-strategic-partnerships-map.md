# 🤝 Nzila Strategic Partnerships Map

Owner: Aubert

*Version 1.1 – Venture-Stage Alignment (2025–2026)*

---

### 1. 🎯 Purpose

Nzila’s partnerships are **foundational infrastructure**, not auxiliary strategies. They power go-to-market velocity, regulatory strength, user trust, and research validation.

This map defines how we **structure**, **prioritize**, and **activate** high-leverage relationships across the venture lifecycle.

---

### 2. 🌱 Partnership Philosophy

Nzila forms **deep, principled relationships** — where partners are:

- **Co-designers**, not passive beneficiaries
- **Values-aligned**, not just tactically useful
- **Responsible with data**, consent, and end-user impact
- **Able to grow with us**, beyond early-stage transactions

🤝 *Fewer. Deeper. Designed to scale with integrity.*
