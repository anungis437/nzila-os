# ⚠️ Risk Appetite Definitions

Owner: Aubert

### 1. **Introduction**

**Risk appetite** refers to the **amount and type of risk Nzila Ventures is willing to accept or tolerate** in pursuit of its strategic objectives. This document defines risk appetite levels across key categories of the organization—balancing our innovation-first mandate with our legal, ethical, and fiduciary responsibilities.

These definitions are intended to:

- Guide **executive decision-making**
- Inform **investment, compliance, and operational planning**
- Support **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** consistency across ventures (e.g., **CareAI**, **Memora**, **OptivaCare**, **PuzzleLoop**)

### 2. **Risk Appetite Scale**

| **Level** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **None** | Nzila is not willing to accept any risk in this category. |
| **Minimal** | Very limited risk tolerated; strong controls in place. |
| **Moderate** | Some risk accepted to achieve strategic goals, within clear boundaries. |
| **Significant** | Risk-taking encouraged in pursuit of innovation, with oversight. |
| **High** | High tolerance for risk in pursuit of disruptive outcomes; subject to governance. |

### 3. **Risk Appetite by Category**

### A. **Strategic Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Significant**
- **Rationale**: As a multi-product innovation studio, Nzila Ventures accepts a **high degree of risk** in strategy pivots, new venture launches, and global expansion—provided decisions are **data-driven**, **mission-aligned**, and **reviewed quarterly** by leadership.

### B. **Innovation & R&D Risk**

- **Appetite**: **High**
- **Rationale**: Innovation is core to Nzila's identity. We tolerate failures in R&D experiments (e.g., prototype rejection, exploratory AI models) as part of the process, as long as they are **ethically conducted** and **transparently documented**.

### C. **Operational Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Moderate**
- **Rationale**: We accept operational risk where it supports agility, but seek to minimize failures that would disrupt platform availability, service delivery, or internal continuity.

### D. **Financial Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Moderate to Significant**
- **Rationale**: Nzila is willing to assume **capital risk** in launching new products and entering new markets. However, we maintain **tight controls over liquidity**, investor obligations, and burn rates.

### E. **Reputational Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Minimal**
- **Rationale**: We protect our credibility and public trust—especially in health- and care-related ventures. Public messaging, brand alignment, and ethical integrity are **non-negotiable**.

### F. **Legal & Compliance Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Minimal**
- **Rationale**: We will **not tolerate violations** of privacy, IP, labor, or sectoral compliance standards. All ventures must be designed with legal alignment in mind (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, Law 25).

### G. **Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Risk**

- **Appetite**: **None to Minimal**
- **Rationale**: Given our role in handling health and user data, Nzila maintains **zero tolerance for unmanaged security risks**. All platforms must meet enterprise-grade **cybersecurity standards** and privacy-by-design principles.

### H. **People & Culture Risk**

- **Appetite**: **Moderate**
- **Rationale**: We value bold experimentation in **recruitment**, **team design**, and **talent models** but enforce **non-negotiable boundaries** around inclusion, ethics, and equity.

### I. **Technology Risk (AI, ML, Infra)**

- **Appetite**: **Significant**
- **Rationale**: AI is a core differentiator. We embrace technology risks—including model performance variability, edge-case uncertainty, and ethical frontier cases—so long as we maintain **testing discipline** and **companion system safeguards**.

### 4. **Governance and Review**

- **Review Cycle**:
    
    This document will be **reviewed annually** by the **Risk Management Committee** and updated to reflect:
    
    - New ventures/products (e.g., NeuroBridge, Cognition Passport)
    - Regulatory shifts
    - Market conditions or internal reorgs
- **Escalation Thresholds**:
    
    Projects exceeding defined risk appetites must be escalated to:
    
    - Executive Review (Strategic, Financial, Reputational)
    - Legal & Compliance (Privacy, Regulatory, IP)
    - Risk Committee (Cross-functional governance)
- **Integration**:
    
    These definitions inform:
    
    - **Project approval gates**
    - **Funding decisions**
    - **Partnership vetting**
    - **Venture Studio dashboards**
