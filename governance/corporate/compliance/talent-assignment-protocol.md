# 🧠 Talent Assignment Protocol

Owner: Aubert

**How Nzila deploys internal and fractional talent across ventures**

---

### **1. Purpose**

This protocol ensures:

- Strategic, **milestone-tied deployment** of shared team members (engineering, product, content, etc.)
- Clear rules for **availability, time allocation, and cost tracking**
- **Non-competitive access** across ventures based on readiness, equity stage, and compliance
- Transparent **governance of fractional, contract, and full-time resource use**

---

### **2. Assignment Tiers**

| Tier | Description | Eligible Ventures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Assignment** | Embedded FTE or fractional (e.g., product lead, design) | Post-pilot, active scaling |
| **Rotational Support** | Short-term task-based assignment (≤ 10 hours/week) | MVP or design-stage |
| **Advisory or Oversight** | High-level support via weekly check-ins or reviews | All stages (must be Strategy-approved) |

---

### **3. Assignment Criteria**

| Criteria | Requirement |
