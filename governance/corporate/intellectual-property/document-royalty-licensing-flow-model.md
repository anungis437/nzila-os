# 🧾 Royalty & Licensing Flow Model

Owner: Aubert

### 🔹 1. Purpose

This framework defines how Nzila Ventures:

- Monetizes its **intellectual property, brand assets, and shared infrastructure**
- Maintains **central governance and defensibility** post-spinout or during commercialization
- Enables ventures to scale **without IP dilution**, using structured licensing and royalty terms
- Reinforces **portfolio sustainability** through predictable revenue and reinvestment

### 🔹 2. Licensing Triggers

| Trigger | Description | Applies To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IP Usage** | Use of Nzila-owned Companion logic, prompt library, backend stack, telemetry systems | All ventures |
| **Brand Use** | Usage of Memora or Optiva brand, UI kit, or association with Nzila | All ventures |
| **Shared Services Access** | Use of centralized legal, dev, design, or PM services | Pre-spinout only |
| **Commercialization** | Any monetization derived from Nzila IP | Post-spinout only |

---

### 🔹 3. Licensing Framework (Post-Spinout Model)

| Asset Type | Licensing Terms | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core IP (e.g., Companion Engine)** | 2–5% royalty on gross revenue | Spinout uses Memora logic for B2B clinic sales |
| **Brand & UI Kit** | 0.5–1% or flat-rate brand licensing | Spinout retains “Memora” name and UX |
| **Backend Infrastructure** | Optional fee for continued hosting | Supabase hosted and maintained by Nzila |
| **Prompt Library / UX Copy** | Bundled in product licensing tier | Quarterly localization updates included |
| **Custom SDK Licensing** | Board-approved custom terms | University or clinic builds with Companion SDK |

---

### 🔹 4. Internal Ledger Model (Pre-Spinout Use)

Pre-spinout ventures do not pay fees, but their resource use is **logged and valued** for internal equity accounting:

| Resource | Internal Rate (CAD) |
| --- | --- |
| Engineering (IP build) | $150/hr |
| Design & UX | $120/hr |
| Product Ops / Strategy | $100/hr |
| Legal & Regulatory | $180/hr |
| Financial Services | $140/hr |

> Internal ledger balances may convert into equity or repayment on spinout approval.

### 🔹 5. Royalty Payment Mechanics

| Attribute | Model |
| --- | --- |
| **Frequency** | Quarterly, reconciled with strategic/board reporting |
| **Reporting Requirements** | Top-line revenue disclosure + brief usage justification |
| **Royalty Cap** | Total capped at 10% (all assets combined); adjustable at annual review |
| **Escrow Clause** | Optional: royalties deferred to post-raise phase if investor-facing |

---

### 🔹 6. Licensing Agreement Types

| Agreement | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Master IP Licensing Agreement** | Required for core logic, Companion engine, backend use |
| **Brand Licensing Agreement** | Covers all public-facing use of Nzila brand or product naming |
| **Custom IP Use Contract** | Tailored for SDK use, pilots, or limited-scope partnerships |
| **Equity-for-Use Clause** | Converts accumulated IP usage value into equity at spinout stage |

---

### 🔹 7. Compliance & Oversight

| Risk Area | Control |
| --- | --- |
| **Unauthorized Use** | All IP use tied to contract and repository permissions |
| **Royalty Avoidance** | Legal and finance flag missing payments during quarterly review |
| **Investor Confusion** | Brand & IP licensing must be disclosed in fundraising materials |
| **IP Dilution Risk** | Licensing ≠ ownership — clarified in all contracts |
