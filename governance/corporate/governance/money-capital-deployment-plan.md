# 💰 Capital Deployment Plan

Owner: Aubert

### 🔹 1. Purpose

This document defines how **Nzila Ventures**:

- Allocates capital across its portfolio of ventures in a **staged, milestone-based** fashion
- Aligns capital with **strategic inflection points**, not just timelines
- Avoids premature scale, **preserves IP control**, and mitigates risk
- Uses a blend of **internal service credits**, **direct disbursements**, and **spinout triggers**
- Ensures all capital flows are **auditable, defensible**, and **governance-ready**

### 🔹 2. Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Milestone-Based Deployment** | No funding or scaling occurs until defined milestones are met and logged |
| **IP & Equity Integrity** | All capital deployment is tied to centralized IP terms; no dilution without board-aligned terms |
| **Readiness Thresholds** | Venture must demonstrate user validation, regulatory clarity, and infrastructure fit |
| **Governance Before Growth** | All disbursements follow from reviews—not from founder urgency or team pressure |
| **Transparent Accounting** | Internal credits and shared service usage are tracked per venture, per quarter |

---

### 🔹 3. Capital Stages & Triggers

| Stage | Venture Status | Deployment Trigger | Capital Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Discovery** | Idea & user research | Strategic fit confirmed by HQ | ≤ $15K CAD (research, legal shell, founder support) |
| **2. MVP Build** | Core logic + UX started | MVP scope approved + lead assigned | Up to $75K CAD or shared services equivalent |
| **3. Pilot Launch** | Clinic/site signed | IRB or partner approval | Up to $150K CAD, split across internal + external |
| **4. Scaling (Pre-Spinout)** | Usage data + ROI potential | Feedback analyzed, fiscal model validated | ≥ $150K CAD total; board-controlled release gates |
| **5. Spinout / SAFE / Raise** | Governance ready | Cap table + strategic investor memo approved | SAFE or equity-linked deployment; new legal envelope created |

### 🔹 4. Deployment Mechanisms

Nzila deploys capital via the following methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Shared Services Ledger** | Internal time tracked against venture credit (e.g., design, legal) |
| **Direct Cash Disbursement** | Used only in post-spinout ventures or IRAP/grant-matched scenarios |
| **Hybrid (Cost Offset)** | Nzila subsidizes % of eligible external spend (dev agency, IRB, legal) |
| **Milestone Voucher** | Pre-approved unit of work (e.g., “MVP UX Pack – 40h”) tracked in Notion ledger |

### 🔹 5. Shared Services Internal Valuation Table

| Resource | Internal Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Engineering (Full-stack) | $150/hr |
| UX/UI Design | $120/hr |
| Product Ops & PM | $100/hr |
| Legal (Internal) | $180/hr |
| Financial Strategy / Modeling | $140/hr |
| Accessibility / Content / Copy | $90/hr |

> These values are not invoiced to the ventures—they reflect internal valuation for capital accountability and grant matching.

### 🔹 6. Capital Review & Planning Cadence

| Review Type | Frequency | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strategic Capital Review** | Quarterly | Strategy Office + CFO |
| **Biannual Venture Funding Plan** | Twice yearly | Corporate Ops + Studio Leads |
| **Board Review (Trigger)** | Ad hoc | If milestone failures exceed 2 cycles or burn exceeds cap |

---

### 🔹 7. Controls & Compliance Safeguards

| Risk | Control |
| --- | --- |
| **Over-disbursement** | Deployment logs locked per milestone ID |
| **Burn Outpacing Progress** | Pre-spinout ventures capped at $15K/month equivalent |
| **Unapproved Spend** | Shared services blocked without scoped approval |
| **IP Breach** | Legal review required before any externally funded development |

### 🔹 8. Reporting & Audit

| Ledger | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Service Burn Log | Notion + monthly export |
| Capital Forecast | Google Sheets (Finance Synced) |
| Strategic Review Sync | Connected to Q-Review Template |
| Cap Table Risk Log | Triggered once ventures approach spinout |
