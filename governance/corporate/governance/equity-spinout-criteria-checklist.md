# 🪙 Spinout Criteria & Checklist

Owner: Aubert

**Version:** 1.0

**Maintained By:** CEO + Legal

**Required For:** Any new legal entity formed under Nzila's IP license

**Location:** 📁 *Nzila HQ → Strategy & Operating Model → Governance Docs → Spinout Criteria*

---

### 🔹 1. Purpose

To define:

- The conditions under which a Nzila venture (e.g., *Memora*) may spin out as a legally distinct entity
- Required governance safeguards to protect Nzila’s core IP, brand, and board control
- The **checklist of preconditions** for legal, financial, and strategic readiness

---

### 🔹 2. Spinout Definition

A **spinout** refers to the creation of a new legal corporation (federally or provincially incorporated) that:

- Operates a product originated under Nzila's venture studio model
- May raise third-party capital under its own cap table
- Licenses IP, brand elements, or backend systems from Nzila
- Is governed via a **venture-level Operating Agreement** + a **license agreement**

### 🔹 3. Spinout Eligibility Criteria (Must Meet All)

| Category | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Product** | MVP completed, validated with >1 clinic/partner |
| **Revenue or Contracted Use** | Paying customer, active grant, or pilot signed |
| **Team** | Designated CEO or lead with signed Founder Participation Agreement |
| **Legal** | IP assigned to Nzila and internal license agreement drafted |
| **Governance** | Nzila retains majority board control or veto rights |
| **Equity Readiness** | Pre-cap table modeled with board approval pathway |
| **Data Handling** | Legal compliance verified (Law 25, PIPEDA) |
| **Operational Maturity** | Pilot feedback loop and roadmap to scale documented |

### 🔹 4. Required Legal Documents (Pre-Spinout)

- [ ]  IP License Agreement (Nzila → Spinout)
- [ ]  Operating Agreement for new entity
- [ ]  Founder IP Assignment Confirmation
- [ ]  Board Governance Rights Memo
- [ ]  SAFE/Convertible Note Templates (if external raise planned)
- [ ]  Brand Use and Name Rights Agreement (if applicable)
- [ ]  Cap Table Model + Pro Forma

### 🔹 5. Governance Safeguards (Post-Spinout)

| Control Layer | Retained By Nzila |
| --- | --- |
| **IP Ownership** | ✅ |
| **Brand Licensing Rights** | ✅ |
| **Equity Approval Rights** | ✅ |
| **Observer or Board Seat** | ✅ |
| **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** | ✅ |
| **Exit Oversight Clause** | ✅ |

---

### 🔹 6. Optional Delayed Spinout Path

Nzila may choose to delay full spinout but allow:

- Revenue separation and dedicated venture accounting
- A shadow cap table for internal modeling
- SAFE capital raise **within Nzila**, with a side letter for spinout conversion

Used when:

- MVP validated, but team not yet stabilized
- Legal incorporation would add friction for funding or grants
- Data or compliance maturity still in progress
