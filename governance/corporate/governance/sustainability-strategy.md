# 🌱 Sustainability Strategy

Owner: Aubert

### 1. **Purpose**

This strategy defines how Nzila will proactively embed **sustainability** into product development, operations, and long-term growth. It bridges **climate-conscious infrastructure**, **ethical AI**, and **inclusive impact** to ensure our technology enhances—not exploits—the communities we serve.

---

### 2. **Strategic Objectives**

- ♻️ **Minimize environmental footprint** across cloud, AI, and devices
- 🌍 **Advance digital equity** and access across underserved populations
- 🧭 **Align with global frameworks** (UN SDGs, ESG standards, ethical tech charters)
- 💡 **Support regenerative outcomes** in health, education, and cognition
- 🔒 **Uphold long-term ethical AI commitments** through governance, transparency, and safeguards

---

### 3. **Sustainability Pillars**

| **Pillar** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| **Green Infrastructure** | Cloud efficiency, carbon offsetting, sustainable compute sourcing |
| **Inclusive Access** | Product accessibility, mobile-first designs, multi-language/localized UX |
| **Digital Well-being** | Anti-fatigue design, cognitive load balance, data ethics |
| **Responsible AI** | Bias audits, explainability, non-exploitative monetization models |
| **Social Impact** | Supporting caregivers, neurodiverse users, youth, and aging populations |

---

### 4. **Initiatives by Pillar**

### ✅ Green Infrastructure

- Host services on **carbon-neutral cloud providers** (AWS Sustainable Zones, Azure Canada Central)
- Use **energy-efficient AI models** (distilled LLMs, edge AI when possible)
- Implement **usage-aware throttling** in backend systems to avoid wasteful compute
- Offset carbon from AI training runs through vetted climate initiatives

### 🌐 Inclusive Access

- Launch **low-bandwidth modes** for PuzzleLoop, MyLearning Companion, and OptivaCare
- Ensure all products meet **WCAG 2.2 AA standards** for accessibility
- Provide **offline-first capability** for partner clinics and schools with poor connectivity
- Localize UI in **French, Spanish, and Indigenous languages** where relevant

### 🧘 Digital Well-being

- Embed **rest state prompts** and breaks into all gamified systems (e.g., PuzzleLoop)
- Limit push notification frequency and allow **user-controlled AI engagement thresholds**
- Apply **cognitive load balancing** design in interfaces for seniors, caregivers, youth
- Ensure **transparent AI behavior**, avoid parasocial dependency loops

### 🤖 Responsible AI

- All AI systems require **bias audits and explainability reviews** prior to deployment
- Companion models must pass a **non-manipulative design checklist**
- Maintain a **Memory Graph opt-out policy** with irreversible data deletion upon request
- AI outputs must include **confidence indicators and human override pathways**

### ❤️ Social Impact

- Prioritize partnerships that serve **public, community, or hybrid benefit** orgs
- Co-design initiatives with **caregivers, teachers, and neurodiverse individuals**
- Measure impact in **non-financial metrics** (well-being improvements, time saved, caregiver relief)
- Create an **equity-based pricing model** for lower-income or public institutions

---

### 5. **Sustainability Governance**

| **Body/Role** | **Responsibilities** |
| --- | --- |
| **Sustainability Officer** | Drives sustainability integration, reports progress quarterly |
| **Tech Ethics Board** | Reviews AI systems for compliance with ethical, social, and sustainability criteria |
| **Studio Leads** | Ensure product-specific sustainability targets are met and tracked |
| **Ops & Procurement** | Evaluates all vendors and partners for ESG alignment and contract clauses |

---

### 6. **Monitoring & Metrics**

| **Metric** | **Target** |
| --- | --- |
| % cloud usage from green zones | > 85% by end of 2025 |
| % of products with WCAG compliance | 100% of public-facing apps by Q3 2025 |
| Annual carbon offset (tons CO₂ eq.) | 100% of AI-related compute emissions offset |
| Digital well-being user feedback | > 90% satisfied with usage pacing & balance |
| Impact stories published | 4+ per year from caregivers or partner orgs |

---

### 7. **Alignment with Global Frameworks**

Nzila aligns its sustainability efforts with:

- 🌍 **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**
    
    Especially:
    
    - Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being
    - Goal 4: Quality Education
    - Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
    - Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
    - Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- 📊 **ESG Reporting Best Practices**
    
    For future investors, public stakeholders, and internal ethics audits
