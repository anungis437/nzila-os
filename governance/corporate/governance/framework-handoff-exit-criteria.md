# 🧩 Handoff & Exit Criteria

Owner: Aubert

**Defining the moment when a venture, product, or service can be handed off, paused, or exited**

---

### **1. Purpose**

This guide defines the structured criteria and workflows used to:

- **Transition** ventures or service components from incubation to external ownership or automation
- **Pause** or **sunset** initiatives that no longer meet Nzila’s strategic, financial, or mission fit
- Ensure clarity in **IP ownership, continuity planning**, and **team reallocation**
- Maintain **institutional memory** and minimize risk during venture handoff

### **2. Handoff Types**

| Type | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Spinout** | Venture transitions to external legal entity with licensed IP, independent board, and capital structure |
| **Internal Sustain** | Venture/product continues under Nzila with reduced oversight, integrated into core systems |
| **Automation / Archive** | Process or tool is stable and either self-operating or archived with retrieval SOPs |
| **Exit / Sunset** | Venture or project ends with closure plan, IP wrap-up, and audit logs in place |
