# 🧾 Exit & Long-Term Value Framework

Owner: Aubert

*Version 1.1 – Strategic Optionality Without Mission Drift*

---

### 1. 🎯 Purpose

This framework governs **Nzila’s approach to long-term value creation, exit readiness, and stakeholder alignment.**

We do not build to flip. We build to last — with the *option* of a transition that multiplies impact, preserves integrity, and honors our contributors.

### 2. 💡 Nzila’s Value Thesis

Nzila creates value **by designing systems that outlast hype cycles and extractive models.**

| Value Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 **Cultural** | Normalize ethical AI in underserved care communities |
| 🧪 **Clinical** | Deliver measurable gains in cognition, engagement, adherence |
| 💵 **Commercial** | Drive revenue from real-world use, not vanity metrics |
| 🌐 **Ecosystem** | Power third-party tools via APIs, SDKs, and shared Companion UX |
| 📈 **Investor** | Scale without compromising cap table discipline or ethical standards |

> Long-Term Value = (Trust × Scalability × Outcomes)
>

### 3. 📊 Multi-Horizon Value Creation Plan

| Horizon | Focus | Strategic Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **H1 – 2025–26** | Launch Memora + ClinicConnect | Validate retention, clinical trust |
| **H2 – 2026** | Expand Companion & AI personalization | Ecosystem stickiness, LTV depth |
| **H3 – 2027** | U.S. pilots + CareAI / FamilySync | Market expansion + vertical resilience |
| **H4 – 2028+** | SDK/API commercialization | Platform leverage, licensing readiness |

🔁 KPIs we track to assess LTV trajectory:

- Cross-product NPS from clinics and caregivers
- Retention of Companion across products
- Number of opt-in clinics contributing data
- Clinic recommendation/referral rate
- Research publication or co-authorships enabled

---

### 4. 🛡️ Exit Readiness Philosophy

Nzila does not pursue an exit unless it:

- **Accelerates impact** beyond our current pace
- **Preserves caregiver and clinical trust**
- **Maintains platform integrity and privacy protections**
- **Compensates contributors** fairly and ethically
- **Enables legacy continuation**, not hollow acquisition

> Exit optionality ≠ exit dependency.

### 5. ✅ Acceptable Exit Scenarios

| 🔹 **Licensing / IP Buyout** | Partial rights sale or co-branded expansion | ✅ Medium–High |
| 🔹 **Joint Venture / Regional Spinout** | Country-specific partners (e.g., France, U.S.) | ✅ Medium |
| 🔹 **NGO Handoff or B-Corp Transition** | Mission-first, foundation-backed continuation | ✅ Low–Medium |
| 🔹 **IPO (Long Horizon)** | Only if ARR, ecosystem depth, and impact justify it | ✅ Selective |
