# 💼 Fundraising Gatekeeper Guide

Owner: Aubert

### 🔹 1. Purpose

To ensure that **all fundraising activity across Nzila Ventures and its studio-built companies**:

- Aligns with Nzila’s IP, brand, and governance control structures
- Avoids premature or misaligned capital raises
- Is **milestone-gated**, **legally compliant**, and **impact-aligned**
- Preserves Nzila’s central role as **IP licensor**, oversight body, and equity steward

### 🔹 2. Core Rules

| Area | Rule |

| **IP Licensing** | No fundraising permitted until IP license is executed (pre-spinout or venture-level) |
| **Investor Materials** | Pitch decks, memos, and one-pagers must be reviewed by Strategy + Legal |
| **Cap Table Logic** | Must use Nzila’s SAFE/priced templates with fully modeled dilution paths |
| **Governance Rights** | Nzila retains board observer rights, IP reversion clauses, and veto on exit |
| **Raise Amounts** | >$250K CAD = Board approval. <$50K CAD = CEO signoff required |
| **Brand Use** | Any reference to Nzila, Memora, Optiva, or portfolio status must follow licensing guidelines |

| **Brand Claim** | “This is a venture of Nzila Studio, operating in its portfolio.” |
| **Impact Positioning** | Must follow language vetted by Product Ops (e.g., “designed for clinical alignment, not diagnostic output”) |
