# CFO Budget Strategy & Tools

Owner: Aubert

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines Nzila Ventures' financial strategy across planning, cost control, revenue modeling, and strategic capital deployment. It introduces the budgeting approach, essential tools, cost structures, funding timelines, and governance best practices. It ensures all teams and products operate under a unified financial playbook.

---

## 💼 1. Nzila’s Financial Philosophy

Nzila operates under five foundational finance principles:

1. **Every dollar must have an outcome** — tied to traction, learning, or defensibility
2. **Cash flow is as important as innovation**
3. **Build lean, scale smart** — invest in automation before headcount
4. **Grants & equity funding must work in harmony**
5. **Financial literacy is cultural, not just operational**

---

## 🔧 2. Budgeting Structure by Product Line

Nzila tracks budgets at three levels:

| Layer | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| **Corporate (Nzila HQ)** | Legal, HR, admin, compliance, shared tooling, capital raises |
| **Product-Specific** | e.g., Memora – dev, design, growth, cloud infra |
| **Project-Specific** | R&D efforts (e.g., Companion Engine), grant deliverables, pilots |

Each layer rolls into consolidated reporting but is managed by distinct budget holders.

## 💵 3. Key Budget Categories (with Monthly Tracking)

| Category | Notes | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R&D / Dev** | Dev contractors, testing environments, integrations | Monthly |
| **Design & UI/UX** | Figma, design support, asset generation | Monthly |
| **Marketing / GTM** | Ads, branding, web hosting, content | Monthly |
| **Cloud & Software** | Notion, Slack, GitHub, Microsoft, Brevo, AI tools | Monthly |
| **Legal & IP** | Incorporation, NDAs, contract reviews | Event-based |
| **Grants & Admin** | Consultants, time-tracking, program compliance | Project-based |
| **Team (future)** | ESOP reserved, contractor fees, fractional hires | Quarterly forecast |
| **Fundraising Costs** | Pitch prep, lawyers, commissions (if any) | Round-based |

---

## 🛠️ 4. Tools in Use

| Tool | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **QuickBooks Online** | Primary ledger, GL structure, expense classification |
| **Excel/Google Sheets** | Budgeting, forecasting, scenario modeling |
| **Notion** | Team financial literacy, document repository |
| **Slack + Gmail** | Finance workflows, invoice approvals |
| **Canva Pro** | Visualizing investor-ready summaries |
| **Brevo** | Email ops (finance alerts, stakeholder comms) |
| **HubSpot CRM (Light Use)** | Tracks investor and grantor status + financial comms |
| *(Planned: Carta or Pulley)* | Future equity and cap table tracking |

---

## 🧮 5. Forecasting Strategy (2025–2027)

Forecasts are maintained in quarterly rolling models with the following assumptions:

- **Base Case**: Moderate grant success (IRAP, SDTC, AGE-WELL), MVP traction, light advisory costs
- **Aggressive Case**: Early U.S. entry, pilot expansion, soft equity round (500K–1.2M)
- **Conservative Case**: Grants only, 1 product + 1 pilot running lean, delayed revenue

### Forecasted Benchmarks (Illustrative):

| Year | Revenue Target | Burn Rate Cap | Team Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | $0 – Pre-revenue | $12–20K/mo | 3–4 core contributors |
| 2026 | $100K–250K | $30K/mo | 6–8 FTEs or equiv. |
| 2027 | $500K–1M | $40–55K/mo | 8–12 incl. fractional |

---

## 🧰 6. Grant Strategy Alignment

| Program | Role in Budget |
| --- | --- |
| **IRAP Youth or R&D** | Covers dev or technical talent for Memora MVP |
| **AGE-WELL or provincial AI grants** | R&D & Companion + data modeling costs |
| **CDAP (Canada Digital Adoption)** | Systems audits, workflow automation |
| **Futurpreneur / BDC** | Bridge funding for launch marketing and ops |
| **CIF or SDTC** | Longer-term platform consolidation efforts |

🧭 All grants are entered in a **master Grant Calendar** with milestones and audit flags.

---

## 🧱 7. Capital Discipline & Oversight

- Budget accountability is owned **by product owners + finance team**
- **Quarterly reviews** against actuals
- New tool or hire requests go through a **2-step approval**:
    1. Does it align with product growth or defensibility?
    2. Does it create recurring financial obligations?
