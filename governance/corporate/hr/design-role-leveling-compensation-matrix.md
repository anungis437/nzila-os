## 🧭 1. Purpose

To define a transparent role leveling system and compensation strategy that balances mission-driven hiring, budget discipline, and long-term equity participation. It serves founders, employees, contractors, and investors by clarifying how roles are structured, paid, and rewarded.

## 🔹 2. Leveling Framework Overview

Nzila uses a **six-level** system for roles across all departments (tech, growth, design, legal, clinical, operations):

| Level | Title Example | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Intern / Junior Contributor | Limited scope, supervised work | Contract or Grant-funded |
| L2 | Associate / Specialist | Executes on workstream, light autonomy | Contract / PT |
| L3 | Lead / Senior Specialist | Owns a function or stream, grants oversight | PT or FTE |
| L4 | Manager / Product Owner | Cross-functional ownership, outputs + outcomes | FTE or Fractional |
| L5 | Director / CxO | Strategic leadership, governance responsibility | FTE, Equity |
| L6 | Founder / CEO | Founder-level oversight, product & investor ownership | Equity, Board-level |

---

## 💰 3. Compensation Philosophy

Nzila prioritizes **lean cash, generous equity**. Compensation depends on:

- Role level + responsibilities
- Time commitment (FTE, PT, fractional, advisory)
- Funding stage or grant program
- Strategic vs. tactical contribution
