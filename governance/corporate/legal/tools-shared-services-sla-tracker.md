# 🛠️ Shared Services SLA Tracker

Owner: Aubert

### 🔹 1. Purpose

To ensure **transparent, measurable support delivery** from Nzila’s internal teams to all active ventures by:

- Defining service categories, deliverables, and timelines
- Establishing internal billing equivalencies (for capital accounting)
- Logging usage per venture to support equity, forecast, or spinout planning
- Preventing service overload or unmanaged demand from incubated ventures
