## 🎨 Design Patterns

All pages follow consistent UnionEyes patterns:

### Layout
- **Client Components** (`"use client"`)
- Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions
- Responsive grid layouts (mobile-first)
- Gradient backgrounds with backdrop blur
- Max-width containers (max-w-7xl)

### Header Structure
```tsx
- Breadcrumb navigation (Back button)
- Page title with icon
- Description text
- Action buttons (Export, Primary action)
```

### Statistics Cards
- 4-column grid (responsive)
- Icon with colored accent
- Large number display
- Supporting text/context

### Filtering
- Search input with icon
- Select dropdowns for filters
- Consistent spacing and layout
- Responsive grid

### Tabs
- Shadcn/ui Tabs component
- Icon + label format
- Consistent tab content structure

---

## 🔌 Integration Points

### Required Props
All pages expect:
- `organizationId` from `useOrganizationId()` hook
- `user` object from `useUser()` hook

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)

```typescript
// Statistics
GET /api/health-safety/dashboard?organizationId={id}&period={period}
GET /api/health-safety/incidents/stats?organizationId={id}&period={period}
GET /api/health-safety/inspections/stats?organizationId={id}
GET /api/health-safety/hazards/stats?organizationId={id}

// Data Operations
POST /api/health-safety/incidents
POST /api/health-safety/hazards
GET  /api/health-safety/incidents?organizationId={id}
GET  /api/health-safety/inspections?organizationId={id}
GET  /api/health-safety/hazards?organizationId={id}

// Export
GET /api/health-safety/export?type={incidents|inspections|hazards}
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Permissions

### Current Implementation
- Organization-level checks via `useOrganizationId()`
- User authentication via platform auth
- Graceful fallback when no organization selected

### Recommended Permissions
Based on `lib/auth/roles.ts`:

```typescript
// View permissions
VIEW_HEALTH_SAFETY_CLAIMS
VIEW_ANALYTICS

// Create/Manage permissions
CREATE_HEALTH_SAFETY_CLAIM
MANAGE_HEALTH_SAFETY

// Role suggestions
HEALTH_SAFETY_REP - Full access
STEWARD - View + Create
MEMBER - View own + Create
```

---

## 🌐 Internationalization

All pages use `next-intl`:

```typescript
const t = useTranslations();
```

### Translation Keys Needed

Add to your messages JSON:

```json
{
  "healthSafety": {
    "title": "Health & Safety",
    "incidents": "Incidents",
    "inspections": "Inspections",
    "hazards": "Hazards",
    "reportIncident": "Report Incident",
    "scheduleInspection": "Schedule Inspection",
    "reportHazard": "Report Hazard",
    "export": "Export",
    "filters": "Filters",
    "search": "Search..."
  }
}
```

---

## ♿ Accessibility

All pages implement:
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatible
- Color contrast compliance

---

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

```css
Mobile:  < 768px   (1 column)
Tablet:  768-1024px (2 columns)
Desktop: > 1024px   (3-4 columns)
```

All pages are fully responsive with mobile-first design.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement API endpoints** for real data
2. **Add permission checks** at page/component level
3. **Complete translations** for all text
4. **Add role-based feature toggling**
5. **Implement export functionality**
6. **Add detailed incident/inspection/hazard views**
7. **Create training module page**
8. **Add dashboard to navigation sidebar**

---

## 📝 Notes

- All pages currently use mock data - replace with API calls
- Toast notifications use Sonner library
- All components are from `@/components/health-safety`
- Animation delays create smooth sequential loading
- Export functions are placeholders - implement file generation

---

1. Follow the established pattern (Header → Stats → Filters → Tabs)
2. Use consistent motion animations
3. Include proper TypeScript types
4. Add to this README
5. Document API requirements
6. Include translation keys
