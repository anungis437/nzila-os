There are quite a few of these two issues that I think are missing in terms of production. There are also the places where things are found. Like, everything is paper at the moment.

Like, when we receive a body, well, at 22-25, let's say, well, there, Christine is going to place it on the 15th floor. Well, it's written on paper, it's on the garage sheet, that it's in the 15th floor. But, like, we should have somewhere, well, again, it could be in Zoho, that it's in the 15th floor.

Because I have to go tell them in Excel that it's in the 15th floor. So, we're writing it again, two places. Because when I'm ready to make my body, well, I want to know where it is.

So, I have to go check on the garage door because she told me it's on the 15th floor. And new boxes too. If we make a new maple box, well, it's the girls in the shop who decide where to put it.

But, you know, the shop is not big enough. It's not a big deal. It takes me two minutes to find where it is.

But, you know, if we had a factory, I guess we would have to put bins. I know there's that in Zoho. Like, straight bins.

And then, well, you're going to look. You know, it says on the 12th floor. At least, you know where it is.

But, you know, it's not big enough for us. Right now, we're looking. So, it's not a big deal.

But, well, one day, it can still become a problem. Thank you, Obie! Don't let go of the potato!
