# CourtLens — Scripts-Book Overview

This scripts-book is the single-source runbook for **CourtLens**
(repository: `courtlens-platform`). Every chapter pairs human-readable documentation
with executable scripts so that any engineer can bootstrap, build, test, deploy,
and operate the application without tribal knowledge.

## How to use this book

1. Read chapters in order for a first-time setup.
2. Jump to any chapter as a reference once you are familiar with the stack.
3. Run the companion `.sh` (Unix), `.ps1` (Windows), or `.py` (Python/cross-platform) scripts directly — they are kept in strict triplet parity.

## Chapter index

- **00-overview** — You are here.
- **01-repo-bootstrap** — Clone, install, configure environment.
- **02-monorepo-structure** — Workspace layout and turbo tasks.
- **03-auth-and-tenancy** — Authentication provider and multi-tenant model.

## Conventions

- All app-specific values use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for easy templating.
- Every chapter contains a `README.md` explaining its purpose.
- Script files always come in `.sh` / `.ps1` / `.py` triplets to guarantee cross-platform parity.
