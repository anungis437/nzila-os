# CourtLens — Governance

This document defines the branch strategy, review requirements, and release
process for the courtlens-platform repository.

## Branch Strategy

The repository uses the following long-lived branches:

- **main** — production-ready code; staging deploys trigger on push
- **staging** — optional integration branch for pre-production validation
- **feature/*** — short-lived branches for individual changes

All work flows through feature branches into `main` via pull request.

## Pull Request Requirements

Every pull request must satisfy:

- At least **one approving review** from a code owner
- All required status checks passing (see below)
- No unresolved review conversations
- A clear description linking to the relevant issue or task

## Required Status Checks

The following checks must pass before a PR can be merged into `main`:

- `lint` — ESLint / style checks
- `type-check` — TypeScript compilation
- `test` — unit and integration test suite
- `build` — production build verification

These are enforced via branch protection rules maintained by
anungis437.

## Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning:

1. Merge all target PRs into `main`.
2. Create an annotated tag: `git tag -a v<major>.<minor>.<patch> -m "release notes"`.
3. Push the tag: `git push origin v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
4. The production deployment workflow triggers automatically.
5. Create a GitHub Release from the tag with a changelog summary.
