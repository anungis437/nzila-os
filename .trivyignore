# Trivy CVE suppressions
# Only suppress CVEs that are in upstream base images beyond our direct control.
# Each entry MUST have a justification comment and an expiry review date.

# Go stdlib CVEs present in Node.js Alpine base image binaries (npm/corepack).
# These come from Go-compiled tools bundled in the official node:22-alpine image.
# We cannot fix these — they require an upstream Node.js Alpine image rebuild.
# Review: check monthly whether a newer node:22-alpine resolves these.
