# Trivy CVE suppressions
# Only suppress CVEs that are in upstream base images beyond our direct control.
# Each entry MUST have a justification comment and an expiry review date.

# Go stdlib CVEs present in Node.js Alpine base image binaries (npm/corepack).
# These come from Go-compiled tools bundled in the official node:22-alpine image.
# We cannot fix these — they require an upstream Node.js Alpine image rebuild.
# Review: check monthly whether a newer node:22-alpine resolves these.
CVE-2024-24790   # golang net/netip: unexpected behavior from Is methods (in base image Go binaries)
CVE-2025-68121   # golang crypto/tls: unexpected session resumption (in base image Go binaries)

# .gitleaks.toml is a security scanner config file — the regex patterns inside it
# (e.g. sk_test_placeholder) are detection rules, not real secrets.
# Trivy secret scanner flags the file as CRITICAL because the patterns look like secrets.
# Review: permanent suppression — gitleaks config is by definition not a secret.
